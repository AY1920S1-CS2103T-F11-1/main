<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of a Software Engineering project, my team and I were tasked with transforming an existing AddressBook desktop application
into any application of our choice, so long as it maintained a Command Line Interface and had a Graphical Display. We chose to
transform the existing application into a Hackathon manager that is capable of managing the different workflows required for any
Human Resource/Administrative Manager to organise a Hackathon. Named after Batman&#8217;s trusty butler, Alfred allows Hackathon
organisers to keep track of the individuals taking part in the Hackathon, assign participants to teams, visualise statistics
and even import data from .csv files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After several rounds of iterations and improvements, we are proud to present Alfred:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 1. Alfred&#8217;s User Interface</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My main contribution to the team was to adapt the existing Storage implementation to fit the new application&#8217;s purpose, and
to implement the <code>undo</code>, <code>redo</code> and <code>history</code> features. In addition to this, I also implemented the Command History Navigation
feature, which allows users to navigate to previously executed commands using keyboard shortcuts - a near-universal convenience
feature provided in several Command Line prompts.</p>

<h3 id="features-contributions"><a class="link" href="#features-contributions">Features Contributions</a></h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong> Adapted Storage to fit the needs of Alfred.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Purpose: My contribution was to allow Alfred&#8217;s data types to be stored to and read from disc.
I also ensured that Alfred&#8217;s various EntityLists could be serialized
to JSON and saved to disc in a convenient manner, while guaranteeing that all data read from disc is first validated before
being sent to Alfred so that corrupted data will not cause further problems upstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Storage is a key component in Alfred and ensures that all data changes can be automatically saved and
persisted. This is critical for Alfred. Hackathon-organising is a long-term, large-scale effort, so being able to save your
data reliably is key to the application&#8217;s success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: There is no need for users to save their data as Alfred always automatically saves the data to Storage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong> Created an undo/redo feature.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Purpose: Allows users to undo/redo previously executed commands. This allows users to easily correct mistakes while using Alfred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Should users make a mistake or have a need to reverse previously executed commands, this feature allows them
to quickly revert changes by invoking the <code>redo</code> command, improving their overall productivity and streamlining workflows with the application. Should they
change their mind and actually wish to execute the command again, there is no need for them to re-type and execute the command,
as they can simply invoke the <code>redo</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: You can undo/redo multiple commands at once, by invoking <code>undo N</code>/<code>redo N</code>, where N is an integer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Enhancement</strong> Allow users to view the history of previously executed commands</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Purpose: Allows users to keep track of the changes they make</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Especially after invoking several commands, it can be difficult for users to remember the order of commands they
had previously executed. Hence, the <code>history</code> command provides a convenient visualisation of previously executed commands to
better inform users on which commands they would like to <code>undo</code>/<code>redo</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Enhancement</strong> Allow users to navigate to previously executed commands using the ALT + UP/DOWN Arrow Keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purpose: Allow quick access to previously executed commands, as opposed to re-typing everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This is a convenience feature that most Command Line prompts have, so it is a nice feature for Alfred to
include, given that Alfred is ultimately a Command Line Interface.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Highlights: Users can navigate up to 50 previous commands.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This command is to facilitate the undo/redo commands, as it becomes easier for you to track what changes were made before, and which
commands can be undone/redone. This is especially useful when many commands have been executed and it is difficult to remember the sequence of
execution of the commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Executing the command will bring you to the "History" section of Alfred, which displays all the previously-executed
commands as panels. There are 3 main delimiters. Each delimiter is just a visual representation of the limits for the undo/redo commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot redo any command beyond the "redo" delimiter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot undo any command beyond the "undo" delimiter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "current" delimiter tells you where you are at relative to the rest of the commands you have executed. It represents the
current state of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that only commands that change the state of the data in Alfred will be displayed in the "History" section and are undo/redo-able.
For instance, <code>list participants</code> will not be undo/redo-able, as it simply shows you the participants in Alfred and does not change any information in Alfred.
On the other hand, invoking <code>add participant</code> with the suitable parameters will be undo/redo-able and will be shown in the "History" section by the <code>history</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In total, only 50 states will be stored, so this serves as a limit for the number of commands you can undo/redo to.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The topmost panel is the "redo" delimiter.<br>
The second panel from the top is the "current" delimiter.<br>
The bottommost panel shows you the "undo" delimiter.<br>
In this example, the output of the <code>history</code> command shows you can invoke the <code>undo</code> command four times.
Notice that the <code>list participants</code> command is not shown in the "History" section as it does not change data.<br>
Also note that the undo-able commands are numbered, with the 1st undo-able command being the most recently executed command (the EditParticipantCommand),
and the 4th undo-able command being the oldest executed command. In this case, the maximum number of commands you can undo at once is 4.
Also note that in this case, no commands are redo-able, that&#8217;s why there are no panels between the "redo" and "current" delimiters. Hence, executing <code>redo</code> command will result in an error.</p>

<p>Navigate to previous commands by pressing the alt key <kbd>Alt</kbd>, together with the up <kbd>&uparrow;</kbd> or down <kbd>&downarrow;</kbd> arrow keys.
For Mac users, press the option key <kbd>Opt</kbd> in place of the alt key <kbd>Alt</kbd> instead. Should you have re-mapped/re-purposed the
alt key <kbd>Alt</kbd>, press the remapped key on your keyboard instead.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every time you execute a command <strong><em>successfully</em></strong>, the command is saved in Alfred, so you can navigate to a previous command without re-typing the whole thing.
There is only 1 exception to this rule: the <code>import</code> command can be navigated to even if there are errors raised during execution.
This is because the <code>import</code> command will do its best to import as many Entities into Alfred as possible, before finally notifying the user of any incorrect entries (so there is partial successin the command&#8217;s execution).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + up <kbd>&uparrow;</kbd> to navigate to the previous command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + down <kbd>&downarrow;</kbd> to navigate to the next command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unlike most of the other features in Alfred, this is not a command you type into Alfred&#8217;s command input box. This is a keyboard shortcut that is mainly for your convenience as it allows you to quickly re-use previously executed commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that Alfred&#8217;s command input box must be in focus (the cursor is active in the command input box) for the keyboard shortcuts for this feature to work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This feature only allows you to navigate up to the previous 50 successfully executed commands.</p>
