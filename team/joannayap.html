<div class="paragraph">
<p>My team and I were tasked with enhancing an desktop application, which is command line interface addressbook application. After careful consideration, we have morphed the application into a Hackathon personnel management system called Alfred. With the target user of Human Resource Managers of small to medium sized enterprise and start-ups in mind, we created this application help streamline the management of Hackathon. This improved application enables users to manage different parties of participants, teams and mentors. Additionally, it automatically establishes relationship between these parties, delegating the tedious task of maintaining complex relationships to the system itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is what our project looks like:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 1. The graphical user interface for the homepage of Alfred.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My main role was to design and write the code for the Graphical User Interface(GUI) to ensure that information about each party(participant, team and mentor alike) is displayed in an organised and readable manner. Additionally, as part of my duty, I have also implemented the command prompt box and homepage statistics. This ensures that users do not need to type out complex commands and that they are well informed of the statistics of different parties in the system. I have also implemented assign and remove commands to assign participants or mentors to a team. The following sections illustrate these enhancements in further detail, including the relevant documentation I have included in the user and developer guide with reference to these features.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note the following terms used in this document</strong>:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Entity</strong>: The term entity refers to different parties that could be stored in the system. This includes participants, teams and mentors that are involved in the Hackathon competition.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancement added</strong>: I have improved on the design of the GUI</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: There are two main features of the GUI. The first feature is the sidebar. The sidebar consist of different sections. When commands are entered, the result will be shown, with respective sections of the sidebar highlighted for reference. Secondly, I have also implemented the parsing and display of information returned by the backend into cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Upon entering commands into the application, the result of these commands will return the details of different entities. Parsing and displaying these information into a more visual manner will allow users to be able to digest such information easily and intuitively. Furthermore, being able to view the section of the sidebar that is highlighted will give the user a clearer idea of the type of entity they are looking at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: Two third party libraries are used. They are Jfeonix and FontAwesomeFx Library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Code contributed</strong>: Please click these links to see a sample of my code: [Functional code] [Test code] {give links to collated code files}</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added</strong>: I added the ability to view statistics on the homepage of the application</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The home command allows the user to navigate to the homepage of the application. The homepage displays statistics that informs users on the number of entities ( by their entity type), as well as the distribution of entity by subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Hackathon competitions may be a measurably large event with large volumes of entities stored in the system. Hence, the overall view of the total number of each entity is needed to keep the maximum capacity of the competition in check. Additionally, the distribution graph of entities by subjects will allow optimal allocation of participants into teams or mentors to teams (according to their subject of choice).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The implementation of the distribution graph requires sieving through entities of the same type by subjects. Therefore, the Stream data structure was used to create a more elegant solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: JavaFX library was used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Code contributed</strong>: Please click these links to see a sample of my code: [Functional code] [Test code] {give links to collated code files}</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added</strong>: I added the ability to choose from different suggested command templates as a user types into the user input box</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: This feature predicts the command that a user is going to enter as they are typing, and provides suggestions. The user can then navigate and choose from these suggestions. Doing so will provide a command template for the user to work it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Managing different entities in the system requires a variety of commands(in which some are more complex in nature). Thus, this feature allows users to conveniently summon commands. Furthermore, it takes the memory work of remembering numerous commands out of the equation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. Addition of new commands would only require minimal changes to the code base of this feature. The fulfilment of this feature was more demanding as it requires a deeper understanding on the working of the third party library JavaFX. On top of that, its implementation was constantly met with errors, before vital concepts regarding the Node components of JavaFX came into light.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Credits: This was inspired by the command suggestion box in Telegram bots. The inspiration of how it can be implemented comes from the following webpage: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50495430/how-to-customize-auto-complete-text-field-suggestion-in-javafx" class="bare">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50495430/how-to-customize-auto-complete-text-field-suggestion-in-javafx</a></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added</strong>: I added the ability to assign participants or a mentor to a team</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The assign participant and assign mentor command assigns a participant or mentor to a team. The remove participant or remove mentor command removes said entity from the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Hackathons involves teaming participants up and allocating a mentor to guide teams. This feature helps to establish this relation.</p>
