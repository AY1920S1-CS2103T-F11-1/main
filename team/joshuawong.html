<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of our software engineering project, my team of five, including me, were tasked with either improving
the existing AddressBook3 application codebase, or morphing it into any application, as long as
it maintained a command line interface and had a graphical display. We opted for the latter and morphed the
AddressBook3 codebase into a Hackathon manager, named Alfred. Alfred is targeted at Hackathon HR managers to aid them in
the organization of hackathons, including the logistics and administration. Alfred packages multiple
features into a single application, such as but not including judging, data validation, find, undo/redo, a
whole new UI and more!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Alfred, I was mainly in charge of the Model backend, the find command and the enhancement of existing commands.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong>: Added <strong>the <code>find</code> command to perform advanced search on the stored data</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: This functionality enables the user to search for users in the database via different fields
and complements the preexisting <code>view</code> command, which only gets a single user by <code>ID</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This functionality makes searching for users extremely convenient, especially if
the hackathon has hundreds of participants. It also can return multiple users that match the given search
parameters in a single command, which makes it more efficient than the more specialized <code>view</code> command and
removes the need for the hackathon organizer to remember randomly generated <code>ID</code> numbers. This functionality
makes Alfred a viable alternative to existing software like Excel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: Like existing query languages, the <code>find</code> command supports a powerful search, allowing users
to search by intersection, union across multiple fields and to perform a negative search on selected fields.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong>: Refactored and implemented the new <code>Model</code> for Alfred</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The preexisting AddressBook3 codebase only has the relevant objects for the address book
application. However, Alfred required new objects such as <code>Score</code>, <code>Participant</code> and <code>Team</code>, and
new methods for the other parts of the codebase to interact with this in-memory data. It is also the only component
of the codebase that interacts with <code>Storage</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification:  Without the new objects created by <code>Model</code>,
it would also impossible to store anything in memory. The methods exposed by <code>Model</code> are the only way that the other
parts of the object can interact with the in-memory data.
Thus, <code>Model</code> serves as a single source of truth for the application in order to ensure that the
hackathon information managed by the application is accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: It abstracts all the details and validation away. Other objects which call <code>Model</code> can be assured that
their input will be validated and stored correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: Updated the <code>help</code> command UI to reflect the new commands in Alfred.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default <code>find</code> command for single and multiple fields works via a find by intersection. That is, entities
must be true for all the predicates for it to be displayed. However, Alfred also supports finding by union.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As above, all find commands are case insensitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The commands for this is as such:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>find participant OR n/Damith e/nus</code> will do a search for all Participants whose name contains "Damith" or whose
email contains "nus" in it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also do note that for this command, the OR key must be placed before all the arguments to the command. Also,
the OR key can be replaced by the AND key to do a search by intersection. If none are provided, then a search by
intersection is done by default. The AND/OR keyword must be in caps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, Alfred also supports negative searches, if you wish to do it. Simply run</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>find mentor n/Boss EXCLUDE e/boss.com</code> will return all mentors whose name has a "boss"
and whose email does not contain "boss.com"</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, you can do negative searches by union as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>find mentor OR n/boss EXCLUDE e/boss.com</code> will now return all mentors whose
name has a "boss" in it or whose email does not contain "boss.com"</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there are also some caveats when it comes to using <code>find</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The <code>AND/OR</code> keyword must be placed at the front before all parameters and the <code>EXCLUDE</code> keyword</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything after the <code>EXCLUDE</code> keyword will be processed using negative find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No <code>AND/OR</code> keywords are allowed after the <code>EXCLUDE</code> keyword.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can only search by <code>AND</code> or <code>OR</code>. You cannot do a search by both <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some notes on the logic used in find.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The logic used in find obeys normal boolean, probabilistic logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hence commands like <code>find participant n/Ki EXCLUDE n/Ki</code> will return an empty list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Likewise, commands like <code>find participant OR n/Ki EXCLUDE n/Ki</code> will return the full list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other examples of valid commands are also provided here for your reference:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><code>find team OR EXCLUDE n/ArsenalFC pn/Football</code> will do a search of all teams whose name does not
contain "ArsenalFC" or whose project name does not contain "Football".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>find participant AND n/Abramov EXCLUDE e/react</code> will do a search where participant names contain "Abramov"
and whose email does not contain "react". In this case, the <code>AND</code> keyword could have been omitted because
the default find does a search by intersection.</p>

<p>Each <code>EntityList</code> is also further subclassed into <code>ParticipantList</code>, <code>MentorList</code>, <code>TeamList</code>. Each of
these lists can be seen as an individual address book from the original AB3 project.
In turn, these <code>EntityList</code> objects contain the respective <code>Participant</code>, <code>Mentor</code> and <code>Team</code> objects.
You can see the diagrams for the aforementioned 3 objects in our developer guide <a href="https://ay1920s1-cs2103t-f11-1.github.io/main/DeveloperGuide.html">here</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="usage"><a class="link" href="#usage">Usage</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the ModelManager object is first created upon starting the application, the existing data is loaded from
the disc via methods on the <code>Storage</code> object. However, if there are any bugs in the process, perhaps due
to corrupted data, a new <code>EntityList</code> is instantiated rather than run the risk of working with outdated data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to its role as the API of the application, all calls which require access to the <code>Entity</code> objects will be done
through <code>Model</code> and not via the lists directly. These operations are listed as public methods on the <code>Model</code> interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For operations which would entail mutating the data within the
<code>EntityList</code> objects in any form, <code>Model</code> automatically communicates with the <code>Storage</code> object to save the data.
The saving logic can be found within the <code>Storage</code> object and thus <code>Model</code> only needs to pass it <code>EntityList</code> objects
on its end. The same applies for the other attributes in <code>Model</code>, such as <code>CommandHistory</code>; <code>ModelManager</code> will
automatically communicate with it for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there are any errors along the way, it will be logged but the error would be handled within <code>Model</code> itself.
Moreover, if there is an error during a <code>Model</code> operation, the data will not be saved to disc.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="design-considerations"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations">Design Considerations</a></h4>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Synchronization of data</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The role of <code>ModelManager</code> is to ensure that the data is in sync with each other across all 3 <code>EntityList</code>
objects. The reason behind this is because for example, the <code>Participant</code> object in <code>ParticipantList</code> is a separate
object from the one inside <code>Team</code>. It was not possible due to make the <code>Participant</code> object hold a reference
to <code>Team</code> due to serialization issues on <code>Storage</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As such, for each CRUD operation, <code>ModelManager</code> has to perform validation to ensure that the data modified/added
is sync across all 3 <code>EntityList</code> objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was also the reason why <code>Storage</code> was moved into the <code>Model</code> object, as in the current implementation of
Alfred, only <code>ModelManager</code> needs to communicate with <code>Storage</code>. This would
hence help to better ensure data integrity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Single Responsibility Principle and Inheritance</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each class in <code>Model</code> is only responsible for a single task. For example, <code>TeamList</code> is only concerned
with managing the <code>Team</code> entities stored in it. This would help to improve testability and code quality, especially
since the size of the <code>Model</code> codebase is substantial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inheritance was used to show links between related objects. For <code>Model</code>, the two objects whose subclasses
are related are
<code>EntityList</code> and <code>Entity</code>. Inheritance was used to show this relationship and to reduce the need for code
duplication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Closed Principle</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Model</code> exposes many functions. However, in line with the Open Closed Principle, modifications to <code>Model</code>
come in the form of exposing new methods on it and creating new attributes on the <code>ModelManager</code> object. The methods
on <code>ModelManager</code> were also implemented as simply as possible so that future methods can build on them. This way,
future modifications do not need to edit existing code, reducing the likelihood of regression bugs.</p>

<li>
<p>Design of the <code>Entity</code> objects</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1</strong>: Make the <code>Team</code> object the single source of truth (only <code>Team</code> has references to <code>Participant</code>
and <code>Mentor</code>)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: This would facilitate the serialization on <code>Storage</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: As <code>Participant</code> and <code>Mentor</code> objects no longer hold a reference to the <code>Team</code> object,
it is now possible for their fields to be different from their counterparts stored in <code>Team</code>, requiring
Alfred to do significant validation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2</strong>: Make <code>Participant</code>, <code>Mentor</code> and <code>Team</code> objects store a bidirectional reference to each other</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: The <code>Participant</code> objects in the <code>Team</code> 's participants field are exactly the same objects stored in the
<code>ParticipantList</code>, reducing the need for validation code as they will never be out of sync</p>
</li>

<p>We decided to opt for Alternative 1 as there was no easy solution to solve the issues <code>Storage</code> had with
bidirectional associations. Also, the validation code for Alternative 1 was implemented early and employed
many defensive programming practices, reducing the likelihood of bugs affecting data integrity.</p>

<p>As the single source of truth for the application in runtime, there are many small functions on <code>ModelManager</code> now.
These functions are implemented directly in the file itself. In the future, it may be better to abstract these
functions out into smaller modules as per the Dependency Inversion Principle. It was not done for v1 of Alfred
as refactoring these methods would block developers and slow down feature development velocity. However,
as Alfred scales, it is recommended that this refactoring be done.</p>

<p>Currently, Alfred allows users to view specific entities by their <code>ID</code> using the <code>view ENTITY ID</code>.
However, it may not be convenient for users to remember the <code>ID</code> of specific users, especially since

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help Alfred become a viable alternative to Excel, Alfred also offers an improved <code>find</code> function
that has been inspired by the power of Excel Macros.
<code>find</code> offers a search by a single field and multiple fields. The list of fields that can be searched for
for each entity can be found in the

simply typing in an incorrect <code>find</code> command in the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The find command also offers an option to do a negative search of the fields in the list. This can be
done via the <code>EXCLUDE</code> keyword. All the parameters that come after the keyword will undergo a negative
search. Figure 41 shows an example of this. <code>find participant EXCLUDE n/uc</code> will look for all participants
whose name that does not contain "uc".</p>

<p>By default, Alfred does a search by intersection for the given entity. However, Alfred also allows
the user to do a search by union. This can be done by inserting an <code>OR</code> keyword before all the parameters.

<p>The following sequence diagram shows the sequence of method calls used to display the filtered list

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The left half of the diagram covers creation of the <code>FindParticipantCommand</code> while the right half
details the interaction with the <code>Model</code>. There are 5 main steps in the execution of the command.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><code>FindCommandAllocator</code> allocates the correct parser for the find command based on the entity name
provided. If the entity name is incorrect, then an error will be thrown and execution will terminate.
This step is not represented in the sequence diagram to make it neater.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>FindParticipantCommandParser</code> will then parse the String provided to it. If the string provided
is invalid and does not follow the specified format, an error will be thrown. Likewise, if the find command
is called and no parameters are provided, an error will also be thrown. During the parsing, the parser splits
the input string given into two separate strings, one for normal parameters and the other for parameters
that will undergo negated search. Two separate <code>ArgumentMultimap</code> objects are generated using the two
strings. These <code>ArgumentMultimap</code> objects are the same as the ones found in AddressBook3 and thus behave in a similar manner
and have the same constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are no errors, the <code>FindParticipantCommandParser</code> then creates
a <code>FindParticipantCommand</code> which in turn generates the predicate it would use
to filter the relevant <code>EntityList</code> by. These predicates are stored as static variables in a central <code>Predicates</code>
file. <code>FindParticipantCommand</code> selects the predicates based on which fields are provided in the original
input string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With these predicates, it then calls the <code>findParticipant</code> method on the model with the generated predicate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of <code>Participant</code> objects is then returned, and is also printed onto the console for the user&#8217;s
reference. Then, at <code>FindParticipantCommand</code>, a <code>CommandResult</code> is returned after the smooth execution
of this <code>find</code> operation.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1</strong>: Use a SQL style query string</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: SQL syntax is universally used to communicate with databases and is clean</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Users may not be familiar with SQL</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2</strong>: Use the current format of <code>n/NAME e/EMAIL &#8230;&#8203;</code> (current)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Maintains consistency within the application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: It is not as clear as SQL style syntax</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternative 1 would take the form
of <code>find where name="John" and phone like "123" and not email="gmail.com"</code>.  However,
while SQL-style syntax  is relatively clean and understandable, we decided not to implement this
for the following reasons.
The first reason was that SQL queries are meant to be used for large databases with thousands of columns,
hence, the structure of the query must be clean to reduce the number of bugs made in the query. On the
other hand, each <code>Entity</code> in Alfred only has a small number of fields (less than 6) and thus the current
query format would still be understandable. Secondly, as mentioned above, users may not be familiar with SQL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence, Alternative 2 was chosen as it would be more
user friendly for users to the existing command format instead of memorizing a new format.
Furthermore, implementing a new format would take more time as
the new query format would have to be written and tested thoroughly, thus negatively impacting development
velocity.</p>

<h5 id="aspect-storing-of-the-predicates"><a class="link" href="#aspect-storing-of-the-predicates">Aspect: Storing of the predicates</a></h5>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1</strong>: Store the predicates in a central file (current)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Makes the predicates accessible to the whole application
hence reducing code duplication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: A large conditional statement would be needed in each Command class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2</strong>: Store the Predicates within each <code>FindCommand</code> class</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Each predicate is only used by one class, so this would have resulted in a better separation
of concerns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: A large conditional statement or hash map would still be needed to decide which predicates to
use</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, we decided to use Alternative 1. Although most of the predicates are only used once, they are
all unmodifiable functions that return a predicate in the form of a closure. Thus, the risks associated
with unrestricted access and modification of an object are greatly reduced. Furthermore, predicates are
also used in other parts of the codebase. Hence, it is a good idea to consolidate them in a single location.
Thus, if another class in the codebase needed to implement another predicate, all it had to do would be to check
this central file to see if a similar one was already written, as opposed to trawling though the entire codebase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The large conditional statement was also not a major issue. This is because although it is large, the
code within was understandable and this would have facilitated its extension, as compared to prematurely
refactoring out into smaller submodules.</p>
