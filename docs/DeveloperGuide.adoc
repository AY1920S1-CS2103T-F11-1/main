== Introduction

Alfred is a desktop application to help Hackathons' Human Resource Managers organise a Hackathon event more efficiently and in an organized fashion. Currently, hackathon organizers have to keep track of various different groups of individuals on several different platforms in order to organize this single event. Alfred allows them to ease the  a hackathon's organization by bringing in all those platforms into a single app, thereby offering them greater orderliness and convenience in organizing their event.

Any help on the development of Alfred would be greatly appreciated, and there are a couple of ways in which you could; either by contributing to Alfred's codebase by expanding its features or, testing and improving it's current features. This guide seeks to not only kick-start your journey as a contributor to Alfred by quickly getting you up to speed with how Alfred's codebase and inner workings function, but also hopes serve as a useful reference to current contributors in times or confusion or difficulties.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design
[NOTE]
Image here to the updated in the later milestones.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component

[NOTE]
UI image and description to be updated with the later milestones.

image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Looks at the prefix commandType given in the CommandResult(returned after every Command is executed), as displays the specific EntityListPanel respectively.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
[NOTE]
Logic Architecture image and description to be updated with the later milestones.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AlfredParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This can result in one of two possibilities:
* a new `CommandAllocator` object is created to allocate the user input to appropriate entity-specific `Parser`. The `CommandAllocator` 's `allocate` method then returns a new Command object which is executed by the LogicManager, or
* the appropriate `Parser` is directly called if no specifying is required and returns a new  `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a participant or deleting a team).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete participant P-1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteParticipantCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandAllocator` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the lists of our various entities.
* Model is the bridge between Logic and Storage and provides an abstraction of how the data is stored in memory.
* It exposes a `ReadableEntityList` which only has the list method to remind Logic that the data given should not be modified.
* The UI can be bound to these lists so that it automatically updates when the contents of the list change.
* At the heart of the model are observable lists which allow for the dynamic updating of the UI.
* The `Model` interface also serves as an API through which controller can edit the data stored in memory.

`ModelManager`
* ModelManager implements all the methods exposed by the Model Interface. At its heart, it only contains 3 `EntityLists`
, 3 `FilteredLists` and a `UserPrefs` Object and does all the validation logic needed for the application

.Simple Illustration of ModelManager

.EntityList simplified structure
image::EntityListClassDiagram.png[]


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The Storage component transforms the AB3 implementation in order to support the storage of the 3 main EntityLists (ParticipantList, MentorList and TeamList), as these form the bulk of our data. In future versions, Storage would need to be udpated to support other data for Alfred as well (such as Food and Swag, which are scheduled for release in v2.0).

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::AlfredStorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AlfredStorage.java[`AlfredStorage.java`]

The `Storage` component:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `ParticipantList` data in json format and read it back.
* can save the `MentorList` data in json format and read it back.
* can save the `TeamList` data in json format and read it back.

Details:

* Each Entity has a class to deal with it (i.e. for Participant, you have `ParticipantListStorage`, `JsonParticipantListStorage` etc.). Hence, for the rest of this explanation, Entity will be used as a generic term for Participants/Mentors/Teams.
* The class implementing the `EntityListStorage` is `JsonTeamEntityStorage`. This class is responsible for providing the read/save functionality for the entire EntityList to `AlfredStorageManager`.
* In order to save the entire `EntityList` in JSON, the class `JsonSerializableEntityList` implements the logic for serialization. This is achieved by converting the `EntityList` to a `List<JsonAdaptedEntity>`.
* In order to save each individual Entity, the Entity is in turn converted to a `JsonAdaptedEntity` object, which has methods for converting the serialized object back into an Entity object for `AlfredStorage` to return to `ModelManager`.




[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

To best address the numerous and varying needs of Hackathon organizers, we have packed Alfred with a multitude of different features, each of which seeks to provide the user with the optimal means of tending to their hackathon organising needs. However, with a host of features comes a sizable codebase which can make it daunting for new programmers, and often even veteran Alfred programmers, to understand how certain features have been implemented. This section aims to empower you by introducing you to some of the noteworthy features currently present within Alfred, along with few that hope to add in the future, so that you may better grasp the implementation of these features in a bid to contribute new features and improvements to existing features within Alfred. Despite our best efforts to make the explanations of Alfred's features' as comprehensive as possible, we do advice not to solely rely on this guide for understanding and encourage you to experiment with each feature's code in order to truly grasp it.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is faciliated by `ModelHistoryManager`.
The `ModelHistoryManager` object keeps track of the state of the data in `ModelManager` at the end of the execution of each command. It keep a deep copy of all the EntityList data.

Whenever the `undo` command is invoked, `ModelHistoryManager` returns a `ModelHistoryRecord` which contains the state of the data prior to the execution of the previous command. The EntityLists contained within `ModelHistoryRecord` are then used by the `ModelManager` for its operations.


//It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
//Additionally, it implements the following operations:
//
//* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
//* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
//* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.
//
//These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.
//
//Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.
//
//Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.
//
//image::UndoRedoState0.png[]
//
//Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.
//
//image::UndoRedoState1.png[]
//
//Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.
//
//image::UndoRedoState2.png[]
//
//[NOTE]
//If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit
//()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.
//
//Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.
//
//image::UndoRedoState3.png[]
//
//[NOTE]
//If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.
//
//The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:
//
//image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]
//
//NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
//
//The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.
//
//[NOTE]
//If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.
//
//Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.
//
//image::UndoRedoState4.png[]
//
//Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.
//
//image::UndoRedoState5.png[]
//
//The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
//
//image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]
//
//==== Design Considerations
//
//NOTE: To be updated with the later milestones.
//
//===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes
//
//* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
//** Pros: Easy to implement.
//** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
//* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
//** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
//** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
//
//===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands
//
//* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
//** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
//** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
//* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
//** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
//** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates //Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== Leaderboard and Get Top Teams

The "Leader board" and "Get Top Teams" commands are two very important features of Alfred as they allow the user to automatically sort the teams by their scores, fetch any number of top teams in the competition and identify and break ties between teams conveniently. The execution of either of these commands displays the resultant teams on the UI in their correct sorted order.

==== Implementation Overview

The implementation of these two commands is very similar in nature: they both rely on updating a `SortedList` of teams present within the `ModelManager` class, which is then used to display data on the UI. The class diagram below provides a high level representation of the Object-Oriented solution devised to implement the aforementioned features.

.Leaderboard and Get Top Teams Implementation Overview
image::LeaderboardClassDiagram.png[]

From the above class diagram, there are two important matters to note regarding the implementation of these features:

[none]
* 1. The `LeaderboardCommand` and `GetTopTeamsCommand` are implemented as interfaces which extend the `Command` interface. Any command to do with leader boards or getting the top teams implements either one of these interfaces depending on which command it is.
* 2. The `ModelManager` class uses another class `LeaderboardUtil` which provides utility methods for the Leaderboard and Get Top Teams commands, such as fetching an appropriate number of teams for the Get Top Teams command and breaking ties between teams for both commands.

With the class structure covered, the following sub-sections seek to explain how the different classes in Alfred interact to produce a result for the user, and finally the design considerations that were made.

==== Simple Leaderboard Implementation

The `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` fetches a leaderboard with teams sorted in descending order of their points, and ties between different teams broken *solely* on comparison-based methods (such as which teams has more participants) rather than the "random" method which will be covered later.

Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command "leaderboard tb/moreParticipants". For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to denote a tie-break method and "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants.

[[SimpleLeaderboard-Explanation]]
+
.Interactions within Logic Component for SimpleLeaderboardCommand
image::SimpleLeaderboardSequenceDiagram.png[]

In the above, the `LeaderboardCommandParser` class parses the tie-break part of the command, particularly "tb/moreParticipants". Based on this input, it creates a new `ArrayList<Comparator<Team>>` object and appends the appropriate comparators to it based on the specified tiebreak methods. A new `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` object is then created with this array list as its parameter and returned.

When the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` is then executed, it calls `Model` 's `setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators)` method with the input parameter being the `ArrayList<Comparator<Team>>` passed as parameter for the former's creation.

`Model` 's `setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators)` method updates the `SortedList` of teams within `Model` itself, which is then displayed on the UI when the new `CommandResult` object is created and returned.

Do note that if the user's input did not specify any tie-break methods, hence just being "leaderboard" then the `SimpleLeaderboardCommand` object would be created with an empty ArrayList of comparators.

===== *Design Considerations*
*Aspect:* How to store the sorted list of participants

* *Alternative 1:* Use the existing List in `ModelManager` storing the teams.

** Pros: Easier to implement as lesser extra code involved, as most getters and setters have already been coded.
** Cons: Sorting will be more complicated and potentially slower with large number of teams as the other lists are `FilteredList` objects, whose API doesn't allow direct sorting.
** Cons: An existing List is likely to be used by other commands to display data on the UI, so with any sorting will have to undone each time after use; a process which is prone to careless errors.

* *Alternative 2 (Current Choice):* Use a new `SortedList` object from the JavaFX Library

** Pros: Easy and quick to sort contents with the `SortedList` API.
** Pros: A new list means the sorting will not interfere with any other feature's operations, such as the `list` command which uses the existing `filteredTeamList` holding all the teams.
** Cons: Another List to handle in `ModelManager` which increases the amount of code.


==== Leaderboard with Random Winners Implementation

It often occurs that even tiebreak methods cannot separate two teams in hackathon, for which organizers randomly select a winner from the tied teams, basing it purely on luck. The `leaderboard` command with the tiebreak method `random` is used to provide this functionality.

Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command "leaderboard tb/moreParticipants random". For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to denote a tie-break method and "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants, and "random" is another tie-break method.

.Interactions within Logic Component for LeaderboardCommand with Random Winners
image::RandomLeaderboardSequenceDiagram.png[]

The above sequence follows the exact same logic as that for the Simple Leaderboard as explained in Section 4.2.2 (See <<SimpleLeaderboard-Explanation>>).

However, in this case the `LeaderWithRandomClass` calls the `setLeaderboardWithRandom(comparators)` method of `Model` which essentially breaks any remaining ties after applying the tie-break methods between teams on a random basis.

Secondly, `Model` calls its own method `setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators)`, which essentially resets the `SortedList` of teams clearing it of any sorting, and then applies the new comparators to it, before the algorithm for random winners can be applied to the teams.

==== Simple Get Top Teams Implementation

The `getTop NUMBER` command fetches the top NUMBER of teams sorted in descending order of their points, where NUMBER is a positive integer inputted by the user. Ties between different teams broken *solely* on comparison-based methods (such as which teams has more participants) rather than the "random" method which will be covered later.

Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command "getTop 3 tb/moreParticipants". For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to denote a tie-break method and "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Non Functional Requirements

.  Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
.  The system should not seem sluggish if it contains less than 1500 entities.
.  Project is not intended for use on mobile and only should be used on desktop.
.  The application assumes that the user is comfortable with the concept of the command line.
.  The application is meant to run offline.
.  The application is largely a personnel/HR manager, and is not expected to do anything more than that (eg hackathon finances etc).
.  The application is to be used for a single hackathon only and not for multiple hackathons.
.  The application assumes that the hackathon is a short term affair (no longer than 4 days).
.  The application assumes that this is an English medium hackathon and that no non-English names are expected.
.  The GUI should display the result of commands in an intuitive, organized manner that is readable by the laymen(as part of the organization/ affordability of the application).

== Product Survey

*Google Sheets*

Author: Google

Pros:

* This is extremely versatile as Google Sheets come with a list of extremely helpful macros that could help in the storage of participants.
* The display and UI of Google Sheets is extremely intuitive and will come as second nature to anyone using the web.
* Convenient and accessible by multiple HR personnel simultaneously.

Cons:

* Google Sheets has no concept of objects and thus it cannot accurately depict the relationships between our different entities.
* As above, it is hard to look for relationships between our entities, such as Team/Participant associations.
* Google Sheets may be useful for storing information, but it does not support command line arguments.
* Google Sheets is also unable to perform input validation as it lacks the logic to do so.


[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum. +
   _Note: If you are a OS X user, you might need to run this from your command line instead._

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

_{ more test cases ... }_

=== Deleting a Participant

. Deleting a Participant while all participants are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all participants using the `list participants` command. Multiple participants in the list.
.. Test case: `delete participant P-1` +
   Expected: Participant with id P-1. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete participant P-101212323` +
   Expected: No participant is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.


=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Prerequisites: Create a JSON with corrupted data, or any data at all
.. Test case: Start the application. Logger should  kindly inform you that the storage files
are corrupted and hence it defaults to using empty lists.
