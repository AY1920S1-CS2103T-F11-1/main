== Introduction

Alfred is a desktop application to help Hackathons' Human Resource Managers organise a Hackathon event.
Hackathons are difficult to manage manually as they involve different groups of individuals, each
of whom have a different role to play and agenda to fulfill in the Hackathon. Alfred helps streamline
this organisation and management process, allowing you to quickly get up to speed with the logistics
and administrative details of the Hackathon you are organising.

Furthermore, Alfred is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while
maintaining the benefits of having visual responses in a Graphical User Interface.

Interested? Well, head to <<Quick Start>> to get started. We hope Alfred serves you well!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `alfred.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Alfred.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. Alternatively, if you use a Mac, type the command `java -jar alfred.jar`
on terminal in the jar file's directory to open start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Here are some sample commands you can experiment with:

* *`list teams`* : lists teams in the hackathon
* *`add participant n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com`* : adds a new participant named `John Doe` to the Hackathon.
* *`delete mentor 3`* : removes the mentor with ID 3 from the hackathon.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Prelude - Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which you need to supply. For example, in `add mentor n/NAME`,
`NAME` is a parameter which you need to specify as the mentor's name, for example `add mentor n/John Doe`.
* You can type the parameters in any order. For instance, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`,
you may input `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` and Alfred will still deem it as an acceptable command.
* Words in {curly braces} indicate values for the command that you need to supply.
** For example, in the case of `add {mentor/participant/list}`, you can choose to type `add mentor`, `add participant` or `add team`
* Words in [brackets] indicate values that are optional for the command.
** For example, in the case of `export [CSV_FILE_PATH]`, you can choose to leave out the file path.
* Type your commands in the textbox displayed on the Alfred UI. After you are done typing the command, press ENTER on your keyboard to execute the command.

****
* The fields of the Entity will be displayed on the Graphical User Interface.
****

Examples:
* `list mentors`
* `list participant`
* `list team`

* `list mentors` will list all mentors stored within Alfred.

* `list participants` will list all hackathon participants stored within Alfred.

* `list teams` will list all hackathon teams stored within Alfred.

=== Deleting an Entity: `delete {mentor/participant/team} ID`
Deletes an Entity, so that Alfred will no longer keep track of that Entity.
This is a permanent operation, so please be careful.

****
* Deletes the Entity with the ID that you specify.
* As of version 1.1, the delete operation is permanent and irreversible. Be careful.
****

* `delete mentor M-1` will delete the mentor with ID M-1 from Alfred.

* `delete participant P-1` will delete the participant with ID P-1 from Alfred.

* `delete team T-1` will delete the team with ID T-1 from Alfred.

=== Saving the data: `save`

Data in Alfred is saved to the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need for you to save the data manually.

=== Finding a Specific Entity: `find {mentor/participant/team} NAME`

You may search for Entities via their name, instead of their ID, in case you find that the ID is difficult to keep track of. +

Examples:

* `find mentor n/Joshua Wong` will display a list of all mentors in the Hackathon who are named "Joshua Wong", or have "Joshua Wong" in their name.

* `find participant n/John Doe` will display a list of all participants in the Hackathon who are named "John Doe", or have "John Doe" in their name.

* `find team n/FutureHackathonWinner` will display a list of all teams in the Hackathon that are named "FutureHackathonWinner", or have "FutureHackathonWinner" in their name.

=== Judging and Leaderboard Features

==== List Team Ranking: `leaderboard`
Use this command to display the ranking of the teams in the hackathon in descending order of their points. Once you run this command, Alfred's UI will display a list of all the teams stored within Alfred sorted in descending order of their points.

==== Get the top k teams: `getTop NUMBER`
Use this command to list the top k teams in the leaderboard, where k is a number (NUMBER) which you specify. Essentially, this command will show you a cropped version of the leaderboard. Upon running this command, Alfed's UI will display a list of top "k" teams based on their current score.

Example:

* `getTop 5` will display the top 5 teams with the highest points in the hackathon.

* `getTop 20` will display the top 20 teams with the highest points in the hackathon.

Do note that if you input "k" as a number more than the number of teams in the hackathon, Alfred will simply display all the teams in the Hackathon.

==== Add points: `score add TEAM_ID POINTS`
Adds the value of POINTS to the current score of the team with ID TEAM_ID. Use this command when you want to award a particular team a certain amount of points.

Do note that if you try to award more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 points as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message. If the addition of points makes the team's total exceed the maximum, the score will simply be set to the maximum score.

Example:

* `score add T-1 20` will add 20 points to the score of the team with ID T-1.

* `score add T-5 60` will add 60 points to the score of the team with ID T-5.

==== Subtract points: `score sub TEAM_ID NEW_POINTS`
Deducts the value of POINTS from the current score of the team with ID TEAM_ID. Use this command when you want to take away a certain amount of points from a particular team.

Do note that if you try to subtract more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message. If the subtraction of points makes the team's total go below the minimum (which is set to 0 points), the score will simply be set to 0.

Example:

* `score sub T-1 15` will subtract 20 points from the score of the team with ID T-1.

* `score sub T-5 10` will subtract 10 points from the score of the team with ID T-5.

==== Set points: `score set TEAM_ID NEW_POINTS`
Sets the score of the team with ID TEAM_ID to a new score NEW_POINTS, regardless of the team's current score. Use this command when you want to set a team's score to an exact score, rather than adding or subtracting points from their current score.

Do note that if you try to set more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message.

Example:

* `score set T-1 15` will set the score of the team with ID T-1 as 15.

* `score set T-5 10` will set the score of the team with ID T-5 as 10.

=== Bulk Registration: `import fp/PATH_TO_CSV_FILE`
You may import multiple entities at once into Alfred through the specification of a CSV file.

Example:

* `import fp/C:/User/Hackathon2019/participant.csv` will import data from the participant.csv file into Alfred.
* `import fp/Hackathon2019/participant.csv` will look for the CSV file in your current directory (or the folder where alfred.jar is downloaded).

==== CSV File Formatting
In order for the contents of the CSV file to be correctly loaded into Alfred, the file has to be in the correct format.
