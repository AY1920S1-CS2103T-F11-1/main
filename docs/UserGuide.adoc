== Introduction

Alfred is a desktop application to help Hackathons' Human Resource Managers organise a Hackathon event.
Hackathons are difficult to manage manually as they involve different groups of individuals, each
of whom have a different role to play and agenda to fulfill in the Hackathon. Alfred helps streamline
this organisation and management process, allowing you to quickly get up to speed with the logistics
and administrative details of the Hackathon you are organising.

Furthermore, Alfred is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while
maintaining the benefits of having visual responses in a Graphical User Interface.

Interested? Well, head to <<Quick Start>> to get started. We hope Alfred serves you well!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `alfred.jar` link:{releaseURL}[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Alfred.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. Alternatively, if you use a Mac, type the command `java -jar alfred.jar`
on terminal in the jar file's directory to open start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Here are some sample commands you can experiment with:

* *`list teams`* : lists teams in the hackathon
* *`add participant n/Bartholomew Lim p/97654321 e/barrytheflash@superheros.com`* : adds a new participant named `Bartholomew Lim` to the Hackathon.
* *`delete participant P-1`* : removes the participant with ID P-1 from the hackathon.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Prelude - Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which you need to supply. For example, in `add mentor n/NAME`,
`NAME` is a parameter which you need to specify as the mentor's name, for example `add mentor n/John Doe`.
* You can type the parameters in any order. For instance, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`,
you may input `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` and Alfred will still deem it as an acceptable command.
* Words in {curly braces} indicate values for the command that you need to select and provide.
For example in the case of `add {mentor/participant/list}`, you can choose to type `add mentor`, `add participant` or `add team`
* Whenever you need to specify an ID, the ID will be prefixed with an alphabet indicating the type of the Entity (e.g. M for Mentors, P for Participants, T for Teams).
* Type your commands in the textbox displayed on the Alfred UI. After you are done typing the command, press ENTER on your keyboard to execute the command.
====

=== Saving the data:

Data in Alfred is saved to the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need for you to save the data manually.

=== Viewing help : `help` (Coming in v1.3)

This command displays a help page in a separate pop-up window. Should you require further information,
the pop-up window also includes links to further references and documentation. +

Format: `help`

=== Adding an Entity: `add {participant/mentor/team}`

Use this command to add an entity for Alfred to keep track of. +
****
* Creates an Entity as specified by you. Each Entity object will have a unique ID automatically assigned to it.
* As of version 1.1, you must provide all the fields. There are no optional fields.
****

==== Adding a Participant: `add participant [PARAMETERS]`
Use this command to add a new Participant to Alfred to keep track of for your hackathon.

****
* Participants have the fields "Name", "Phone number" and "Email address" which you must provide.
****

Format: `add participant n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL_ADDRESS`

Examples:

* `add participant n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com`

* `add participant n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com p/1234567`

==== Adding a Mentor: `add mentor [PARAMETERS]`
Use this command to add a new Mentor to Alfred to keep track of for your hackathon.

****
* Mentors have the fields "Name", "Phone number" and "Email address" which you must provide.
* Mentors also have a field called "Organization", which refers to the organization for which they work.
* Mentors also have a field called "Specialisation", which refers which is the field of work they specialise in. The Specialisation must be chosen from the predetermined list of specialisations given in Section (some number).
****
Format: `add mentor  n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL_ADDRESS o/ORGANIZATION s/SPECIALISATION`

Examples:

* `add mentor n/Professor Superman p/91236549 e/clarkkent@gmail.com o/Daily Planet s/Artificial Intelligence`

* `add mentor n/Doctor Batman p/91236549 e/bruce@gmail.com o/Google s/Augmented Reality`

==== Adding a Team: `add team [PARAMETERS]`
Use this command to add a new Team to Alfred to keep track of for your hackathon.
****
* Teams have the fields "Name", "Project name" and "Table Number" which you must provide.
* Teams also have a field called "Subject", which refers the area the team's project focuses on, and must be chosen from the predetermined list of subjects given in Section (some number).
****

Format: `add team n/NAME s/SUBJECT pn/PROJECT_NAME pt/PROJECT_TYPE l/TABLE_NUMBER`

Examples:

* `add team n/Team01 s/Artificial Intelligence pn/EmotionTrain pt/Public Welfare l/12`

* `add team n/HackathonWinners4Sure s/Augmented Reality pn/Path-ify pt/Navigation l/23`

=== Updating an Entity: `edit {mentor/participant/team} ID [PARAMETERS]`

Edits an entity based on the supplied parameter values you supply.

****
* Updates the fields of the Entity with the `ID` you specified to the new fields you type in as the parameter. The ID is the unique identifier for the particular Entity you wish to edit.
* You must provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values you provide.
****

Examples:

* `edit mentor M-1 n/NewMentorName `

* `edit team T-1 n/NewTeamName pn/New Project Name`

* `edit participant P-1 n/NewParticipantNAme`

=== Listing all Entities : `list {mentors/teams/participants}`

Shows a list of all the entities corresponding to the entity you specified that Alfred keeps track of.

****
* The fields of the Entity will be displayed on the Graphical User Interface.
****

Examples:

* `list mentors` will list all mentors stored within Alfred.

* `list participants` will list all hackathon participants stored within Alfred.

* `list teams` will list all hackathon teams stored within Alfred.

=== Deleting an Entity: `delete {participant/mentor/team} ID`
Deletes an Entity, so that Alfred will no longer keep track of that Entity.

****
* Deletes the Entity with the ID that you specify.
****

* `delete mentor M-1` will delete the mentor with ID M-1 from Alfred.

* `delete participant P-1` will delete the participant with ID P-1 from Alfred.

* `delete team T-1` will delete the team with ID T-1 from Alfred.

=== Finding a Specific Entity: `find {mentor/team/participant} n/NAME`

Searches for Entities by their name, instead of their ID, in case you find that the ID is difficult to keep track of. +

****
* Take note that the `find` command only searches and matches the names of each Entity, and does not search in other fields.
****

Examples:

* `find participant n/John Doe` will display a list of all participants in the Hackathon who are named "John Doe", or have "John Doe" in their name.

* `find mentor n/Joshua Wong` will display a list of all mentors in the Hackathon who are named "Joshua Wong", or have "Joshua Wong" in their name.

* `find team n/FutureHackathonWinner` will display a list of all teams in the Hackathon that are named "FutureHackathonWinner", or have "FutureHackathonWinner" in their name.

=== Show Command History: `history`
Shows you up to the last 50 commands that you executed.

****
* This command is to facilitate the undo/redo commands, as it becomes easier for you to track what changes were made before.
* Above the `=` delimiter are the commands that can be re-done. (see the example below)
* Below the `=` delimiter are the commands that can be un-done. (see the example below)
****

Example:
Running `history` could give you the following output in the Graphical User Interface:
```
2. AddParticipantCommand
1. AddTeamCommand
==============================
1. AddParticipantCommand
2. AddParticipantCommand
3. AddMentorCommand
```
Above the `=` delimiter are the commands that you can re-do, listed in consecutive order. Hence, calling the `redo` command will redo the `1. AddTeamCommand` command. Calling the `redo` command once more will redo the `2. AddParticipantCommand` command.

Below the `=` delimiter are the commands that you can un-do, listed in consecutive order. Hence, calling the `undo` command once will undo the `1. AddParticipantCommand` command. Calling the `undo` command once more will undo the `2. AddTeamCommand` command. Note that it is not possible to undo beyond the last listed command below the `=` delimiter.

In other words, calling `undo` will undo the command immediately below the `=` delimiter, and calling `redo` will redo the command immediately above the `=` delimiter.

=== Undo Previous Commands: `undo`
Undoes the previous command you executed.

****
* Undoes the effects of the previous command you executed, and will return Alfred to the previous state (as though you never executed the previous command).
* All commands that can be undone can be found in the output of the `history` command.
* To be certain which command you are actually undo-ing, first run the `history` command and examine the output.
* Only the commands that actually change the data in Alfred will be undo-able. Commands that perform read operations (such as `find` and `list`) will not be found in the output of the `history` command. (Coming in v1.4)
****

=== Redo Previous Commands: `redo`
Redoes the previous command you executed.

****
* Redoes the effects of the previous command you executed, and will return Alfred to the previous state (as though you never executed the previous command).
* All commands that can be redone can be found in the output of the `history` command.
* To be certain which command you are actually redo-ing, first run the `history` command and examine the output.
* Only the commands that actually change the data in Alfred will be redo-able. Commands that perform read operations (such as `find` and `list`) will not be found in the output of the `history` command. (Coming in v1.4)
****

=== Judging and Leaderboard Features

==== List Team Ranking: `leaderboard`
Use this command to display the ranking of the teams in the hackathon in descending order of their points.

****
* Once you run this command, Alfred's UI will display a list of all the teams stored within Alfred sorted in descending order of their points.
****

==== Get the top k teams: `getTop NUMBER`
Use this command to list the top k teams in the leaderboard, where k is a number (NUMBER) which you specify.

****
* This command will show you a cropped version of the leaderboard.
* Alfed's UI will display a list of top "k" teams based on their current score.
* If you input "k" as a number more than the number of teams in the hackathon, Alfred will simply display all the teams in the Hackathon.
****

Example:

* `getTop 5` will display the top 5 teams with the highest points in the hackathon.

* `getTop 20` will display the top 20 teams with the highest points in the hackathon.


==== Add points: `score add TEAM_ID POINTS`
Adds the value of POINTS to the current score of the team with ID TEAM_ID.

****
* Use this command when you want to award a particular team a certain amount of points.
* If you try to award more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 points as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message.
* If the addition of points makes the team's total exceed the maximum, the score will simply be set to the maximum score.
****

Example:

* `score add T-1 20` will add 20 points to the score of the team with ID T-1.

* `score add T-5 60` will add 60 points to the score of the team with ID T-5.

==== Subtract points: `score sub TEAM_ID NEW_POINTS`
Deducts the value of POINTS from the current score of the team with ID TEAM_ID.
****
* Use this command when you want to take away a certain amount of points from a particular team.
* If you try to subtract more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message. If the subtraction of points makes the team's total go below the minimum (which is set to 0 points), the score will simply be set to 0.
****

Example:

* `score sub T-1 15` will subtract 20 points from the score of the team with ID T-1.

* `score sub T-5 10` will subtract 10 points from the score of the team with ID T-5.

==== Set points: `score set TEAM_ID NEW_POINTS`
Sets the score of the team with ID TEAM_ID to a new score NEW_POINTS, regardless of the team's current score.

****
* Use this command when you want to set a team's score to an exact score, rather than adding or subtracting points from their current score.
* If you try to set more than the maximum amount of points (which is set to 100 as default), Alfred will not allow it and will display an error message.
****

Example:

* `score set T-1 15` will set the score of the team with ID T-1 as 15.

* `score set T-5 10` will set the score of the team with ID T-5 as 10.

=== Bulk Registration: `addBulk PATH_TO_CSV_FILE`
You may add multiple participants at once into Alfred through the specification of a .csv file

Example:

* `addBulk C:\User\Hackathon2019\participant.csv` will import data from the participant.csv file into Alfred.

=== Help command (Coming in v1.3)

The help command will list down all the commands you need to use this
application properly!
