== Introduction

Alfred is a desktop application to help Hackathons' Human Resource Managers organise a Hackathon event.
Hackathons are difficult to manage manually as they involve different groups of individuals, each
of whom have a different role to play and agenda to fulfill in the Hackathon. Alfred helps streamline
this organisation and management process, allowing you to quickly get up to speed with the logistics
and administrative details of the Hackathon you are organising.

Furthermore, Alfred is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)*, while
maintaining the benefits of having visual responses in a Graphical User Interface.

Interested? Well, head to <<Quick Start>> to get started. We hope Alfred serves you well!

====
*Prelude - Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters which you need to supply. For example, in `add mentor n/NAME`,
`NAME` is a parameter which you need to specify as the mentor's name, as in `add mentor n/John Doe`.
* Words in {curly braces} indicate values for the command that you need to supply.
For example in `add {mentor/participant/list}`, you can choose to type `add mentor`, `add participant` or `add team`
* Parameters can be in any order. For instance, if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`,
`p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
