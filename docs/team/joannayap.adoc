== About the project
My team and I were tasked with enhancing a command line interface addressbook application. After careful consideration, we morphed the application into a Hackathon personnel management system called Alfred. With human resource managers of startups and small- and medium- sized enterprise in mind, we created this application to help streamline the management of Hackathon competitions. This improved application enables users to manage different parties(like participants, teams and mentors). Additionally, it automatically establishes relationships between these parties, delegating the tedious task of maintaining complex relationships to the system itself.

This is what our project looks like:

My main role was to design and write the code for the Graphical User Interface(GUI), to ensure that information about each party is displayed in an organised and readable manner. As part of my duty, I have implemented the command suggestion prompt. I have also implemented assign and remove commands to assign participants or mentors to a team. These are the two main feature I have implemented, The following sections illustrate these enhancements in further detail, including the relevant documentation I have included in the user and developer guide with reference to these features. Further details on the `home` command feature and layout of the GUI (that I have also implemented) can be found in the user guide and developer guide.

*Note the following terms used in this document*:

*Entity*: Entity refers to different parties that could be stored in the system. This includes participants, teams and mentors that are involved in the Hackathon competition.

*Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document*:
[NOTE]
 This symbol indicates important information.

`remove mentor`  A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the
application.

the architecture of the application. Clicking these text will redirect user to the implementation or interface of the component, class or object.



== Summary of contributions

|===
|_This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other contributions to the project._
|===

*Enhancement added*: I added the ability to choose from different suggested command templates as a user types into the user input box

* What it does: This feature predicts the command that a user is going to enter as they are typing, and provides suggestions. The user can then navigate and choose from these suggestions. Doing so will provide a command template for the user to work it.
* Justification: Managing different entities in the system requires a variety of commands(in which some are more complex in nature). Thus, this feature allows users to conveniently summon commands. Furthermore, it takes the memory work of remembering numerous commands out of the equation.
* Highlights: This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. Addition of new commands would only require minimal changes to the code base of this feature. The fulfilment of this feature was more demanding as it requires a deeper understanding on the working of the third party library JavaFX. On top of that, its implementation was constantly met with errors, before vital concepts regarding the Node components of JavaFX came into light.
* Credits: This was inspired by the command suggestion box in Telegram bots. The inspiration of how it can be implemented comes from the following webpage: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50495430/how-to-customize-auto-complete-text-field-suggestion-in-javafx

*Enhancement added*: I added the ability to assign participants or a mentor to a team

* What it does: The assign participant and assign mentor command assigns a participant or mentor to a team. The remove participant or remove mentor command removes said entity from the team.
* Justification: Hackathons involves teaming participants up and allocating a mentor to guide teams. This feature helps to establish this relation.

*Other contributions*:

* Project management:
â€¢	There were a total of 5 releases, from version 1.1 to 1.5. I managed releases versions 1.2.1 on GitHub.
* Enhancements to existing features:
** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage (Pull requests #36, #38)
** Enhanced delete command to enable the deletion of all entities or more than one entiy (Pull requests #36, #38)
** Added and modified constraints of different fields in the commands(Pull requests #36, #38)
** Implemented dark mode for readability and aesthetic purposes (Pull requests #36)
* Documentation:
** Added user stories and use cases to Developer Guide(Pull requests #36)
* Community:
** Reviewed Pull Requests (with non-trivial review comments): #12, #32, #19, #42
** Reported bugs and offered suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: 1, 2, 3)
*	Tools:
**	Integrated a third party library (FontAwesomeFX and JFeonix) to the project (#42)


== Contributions to the User Guide

== Design Considerations
|===
|When designing the GUI, homepage statistics, command suggestion and assign/remove functions, careful deliberation was needed on optimum data structure to use and design principle to employ to implement these features. Below is a brief summary of the thought process I put in before coming to a decision. _

|How to store a set of correct commands and search through it as user types: In order to provide suggestions as a user types, there needs to be a way to store the set of correct commands as strings in the system, and search through it to check if it contains some parts of user input. The results will be provided to the user as suggestions.
| Use an `ArrayList` and go through every element in the array list one by one to look for commands that matches the user input.

*Pros*: Easy to implement
*Pros*: When new commands are implemented, they can easily be added into the `ArrayList`
*Cons*: Allows duplicates, if duplicate commands are added into the `ArrayList`, duplicate suggestions may be provided.
*Cons*: Searching through the `ArrayList` is inefficient as `Stream` is not used.
|Store the commands in a `Set` and convert it to a `Stream` to search through the commands.

*Pros*: Prevent duplicates, so that duplicate commands will not be entered accidentally.
*Pros*: More efficient.
*Pros*: Easier to search through the set of commands when it is stored as `Stream`.

I have decided to proceed with this option as preventing duplcates enables a more defensive style of programming. It is also more efficient.
