<p>Alfred is a desktop application to help Hackathons' Human Resource Managers organise a Hackathon event more efficiently
and in an organized fashion. Currently, organising a Hackathon is no mean feat, as it requires coordinating
across different stakeholders and managing different sources of data (such as participant and mentor information).
Instead of managing this process across different media such as Excel spreadsheets and emails, Alfred allows
you to coordinate everything in a single, convenient-to-use platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, Alfred is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application packaged with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This means that users are expected
to interact with Alfred mainly through the Command Line, but each command executed will invoke a visual response
in Alfred.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any help on the development of Alfred would be greatly appreciated,
and there are a couple of ways for you to do so
- Contribute to Alfred&#8217;s codebase by expanding its features
- Improve test coverage
- Propose and implement improvements to current features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This guide seeks to not only kick-start your journey as a contributor to Alfred by quickly getting you
up to speed with how Alfred&#8217;s codebase and inner workings function, but also hopes to serve as
a useful reference to current contributors in times or confusion or when faced with difficulties.</p>

<p>Alfred was designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in mind, with a focus on respecting
the SOLID principles. This section serves to give a description of the major components in the architecture
of Alfred. Subsequent sections will provide a lot more information on the inner workings of individual components
and how different components interact with each other for Alfred&#8217;s various features.</p>

<p>The <strong><em>Architecture Diagram</em></strong> given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Main</code> has two classes called <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-1/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java"><code>Main</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F11-1/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java"><code>MainApp</code></a>.

<ul>
<li>
<p>At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#Design-Commons"><strong><code>Commons</code></strong></a> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>LogsCenter</code> : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App&#8217;s log file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rest of the App consists of four components.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#Design-Ui"><strong><code>UI</code></strong></a>: The UI of the App.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#Design-Model"><strong><code>Model</code></strong></a>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Ways to update different entity list</p>

<p>Alternative 1: The system collects information form Model after each command, to display the entity list as the command result.</p>
<div class="ulist">

<p>Pros: Easy to implement with existing Model interface</p>

<li>
<p>Cons: Updating of the data is not automatic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<p>Alternative 2: The system uses and Observable interface that observes for changes in the three types of list, namely ParticipantList, TeamList and MentorList.</p>

<p>How to generate EntityCard and ListPanel to display different entities</p>

<p>Alternative 1: Implement different classes that inherits EntityCard, like TeamCard, ParticipantCard and MentorCard respectively. Additionaly, implement different classes that extents ListPanel, like TeamListPanel and more.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy to implement and style respective cards and list panels.</p>

<p>Cons: Logic is duplicated many times, one for each type of entity. For example, ParticipantCard and Mentorcard are similar for most fields, except the extra field of Organisation and Specialisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons:  Clutters the system with extra classes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative 2: Implement a EntityCard class with a barebone structure. Then dynamically add and morph the fields in Entity card according to the entity type.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: No duplication of the same logic and implementation, as abstraction was used.</p>

<p>For operations which would entail mutating the data within the
<code>EntityList</code> objects in any form, <code>Model</code> automatically communicates with the <code>Storage</code> object to save the data.
The saving logic can be found within the <code>Storage</code> object and thus <code>Model</code> only needs to pass it <code>EntityList</code> objects
on its end. The same applies for the other attributes in <code>Model</code>, such as <code>CommandHistory</code>; <code>Model</code> will
automatically communicate with it for you.</p>

<li>
<p>Synchronization of data</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The role of <code>ModelManager</code> is to ensure that the data is in sync with each other across all 3 <code>EntityList</code>
objects. The reason behind this is because for example, the <code>Participant</code> object in <code>ParticipantList</code> is a separate
object from the one inside <code>Team</code>. It was not possible due to make the <code>Participant</code> object hold a reference
to team due to serialization issues on <code>Storage</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As such, for each CRUD operation, <code>ModelManager</code> has to perform validation to ensure that the data modified/added
is sync across all 3 <code>EntityList</code> objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was also the reason why <code>Storage</code> was moved into the <code>Model</code> object, as in the current implementation of
Alfred, only <code>ModelManager</code> needs to be aware of <code>Storage</code> to ensure that only it can save/read data. This would
hence help to synchronize data better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Single Responsibility Principle and Inheritance</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each class in <code>Model</code> is only responsible for a single task. For example, <code>TeamList</code> is only concerned
with managing the <code>Team</code> entities stored in it. This would help to improve testability and code quality, especially
since the size of the <code>Model</code> codebase is substantial</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inheritance was used to show links between related objects. For <code>Model</code>, the two related objects are
<code>EntityList</code> and <code>Entity</code>. Inheritance was used to show this relationship and to reduce the need for code
duplication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Closed Principle</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Model</code> exposes many functions. However, in line with the Open Closed Principle, modifications to <code>Model</code>
come in the form of exposing new methods on it and creating new attributes on the <code>ModelManager</code> object. The methods
on <code>ModelManager</code> were also implemented as simply as possible so that future methods can build on them. This way,
future modifications do not need to edit existing code, reducing the likelihood of regression bugs.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: This would facilitate the serialization on <code>Storage</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: As <code>Participant</code> and <code>Mentor</code> objects no longer hold a reference to the <code>Team</code> object,
it is now possible for their fields to be different from their counterparts stored in <code>Team</code>, requiring
Alfred to do significant validation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2</strong>: Make <code>Participant</code>, <code>Mentor</code> and <code>Team</code> objects store a bidirectional reference to each other</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: The <code>Participant</code> objects in the <code>Team</code> 's participants field are exactly the same objects stored in the
<code>ParticipantList</code>, reducing the need for validation code as they will never be out of sync</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: <code>Storage</code> serialization cannot handle bidirectional associations</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We decided to opt for Alternative 1 as there was no easy solution to solve the issues <code>Storage</code> had with
bidirectional associations. Also, the validation code for Alternative 1 was implemented early and employed
many defensive programming practices, reducing the likelihood of bugs occurring due to similar objects having
data that is out of sync.</p>

<p>The Storage Component uses the Facade Design Pattern, and exposes the functionality of all the Storage classes

simple, allowing the following methods for each of the 4 data types:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Storage component handles the complexities of actually storing to and reading from disc the 4 different data types.
As can be seen in the figure at the start of this section, underlying AlfredStorage&#8217;s simple interface are several classes
that ensure the accurate storing and retrieval of Alfred&#8217;s data from disc. The following are some details of the Storage
Component:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each EntityList has a designated Storage class (i.e. for Participant, you have <code>ParticipantListStorage</code>, <code>JsonParticipantListStorage</code> etc.). Hence, for the rest of this explanation, Entity will be used as a generic term for Participants/Mentors/Teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The class implementing the <code>EntityListStorage</code> interface is <code>JsonEntityListStorage</code>. This class is responsible for providing the read/save functionality for the entire EntityList to <code>AlfredStorageManager</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to save the entire <code>EntityList</code> in JSON, the class <code>JsonSerializableEntityList</code> implements the logic for serialization for the collection of Entities (i.e. EntityList). This is achieved by converting the <code>EntityList</code> to a <code>List&lt;JsonAdaptedEntity&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to save each individual Entity, the Entity is in turn converted to a <code>JsonAdaptedEntity</code> object. The <code>JsonAdaptedEntity</code> class contains the fields of each Entity that are relevant for saving to disc. Hence, this class is directly serialized into JSON, and also has methods for converting the serialized object back into an Entity object for <code>AlfredStorage</code> to return to <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conversion of the <code>JsonAdaptedEntity</code> object to fields in a JSON file is done by Java&#8217;s Jackson library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following is a concrete example of the storage of a ParticipantList in JSON:</p>

corresponds to the fields in a single Participant object. These fields are generated by the Jackson library from the serializable <code>JsonAdaptedParticipant</code>

the ParticipantList to a List of <code>JsonAdaptedParticipant</code>.</p>

<p>To best address the numerous and varying needs of Hackathon organizers, we have packed Alfred with a multitude of different features, each of which seeks to provide the user with the optimal means of tending to their hackathon organising needs. However, with a host of features comes a sizable codebase which can make it daunting for new programmers, and often even veteran Alfred programmers, to understand how certain features have been implemented. This section aims to empower you by introducing you to some of the noteworthy features currently present within Alfred, along with few that hope to add in the future, so that you may better grasp the implementation of these features in a bid to contribute new features and improvements to existing features within Alfred. Despite our best efforts to make the explanations of Alfred&#8217;s features' as comprehensive as possible, we do advice not to solely rely on this guide for understanding and encourage you to experiment with each feature&#8217;s code in order to truly grasp it.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="BulkRegistration"><a class="link" href="#BulkRegistration">4.1. Bulk Registration</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Bulk Registration feature, referred as the import command, allows you to add multiple entities into Alfred at once through a CSV file. The file must be stored locally as Alfred will attempt to retrieve it through the file path provided by the user. In order for the import command to successfully execute, it is required that the CSV file is formatted according to Alfred&#8217;s requirements, which you can read more about in our <a href="UserGuide.html#ParameterConstraints">user guide</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature will be explained further in the following subsections.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation-overview"><a class="link" href="#implementation-overview">4.1.1. Implementation Overview</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since this feature manages data from a CSV file, import command relies on the <code>CsvUtil</code> class. The <code>CsvUtil</code> class handles reading from and writing data to a CSV file. Below shows the relationships between different classes in Alfred.</p>

<p>In the above class diagram, you can see that</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist none">
<ul class="none">
<li>
<p>1. The <code>ImportCommand</code> uses the <code>FileUtil</code> class, and this is so for a number of reasons. First is to validate whether user inputted file path is, in fact, a valid file path. Once it is verified, another check is done to see if the file exists at the given file path. If the file is not able to be located, the <code>ImportCommand</code> will not complete its execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2. In addition to the <code>CsvUtil</code> class, the <code>ImportCommand</code> also utilizes an <code>ErrorTracker</code> class. This class will store any lines in the CSV file that is invalid along with the reason why it is so. Each <code>Error</code> object referenced by the <code>ErrorTracker</code> will correspond to one line in the CSV file and the cause of the error.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a valid user input is parsed and passed into the <code>ImportCommand</code>, the command will open the file and read its content line by line. Each line is then parsed into the corresponding entity by the <code>CsvUtil</code> class. This will be explained further <a href="#implementation-parsing-of-entities-by-code-csvutil-code">below</a>. The following sequence diagram shows the steps involved in mass importing data into Alfred.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>FileUtil</code> shown in the <a href="#ImportCommandClassDiagram">class diagram</a> was omitted from the above sequence diagram for simplicity as it adds little to the overall flow of execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the above figure shows, the file path from the user input is extracted and passed as a field for <code>ImportCommand</code>. Then, Alfred proceeds to convert file content into relevant entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <code>ImportCommand</code> parses and adds entities to <code>Model</code>, it is crucial that teams are the last entities to be added. In the above sequence diagram, this process of buffering teams was also omitted for simplicity. Basically, in the <code>parseLineToEntity()</code> method, if a line in CSV file corresponds to a team, the line will be buffered to be parsed after all the other lines have been parsed. The reason for this is because teams may have dependencies on other participants and mentors. It is required that all of the participants and mentors associated with a team, say Team A, exist inside the <code>Model</code> before Team A can be added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So as <code>ImportCommand</code> accesses the CSV file line by line, the line representing a team will be stored in a <code>Queue&lt;String&gt;</code> for later use. When the end of file is reached and all other participants and mentors are parsed and added to <code>Model</code>, the <code>ImportCommand</code> will poll from the <code>Queue</code>, parse into a relevant team, and add it to the <code>Model</code> until the <code>Queue</code> is empty.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned before, the <code>CsvUtil</code> class is used to aid in parsing of CSV lines into entities. The process in which <code>CsvUtil</code> parses each entity is heavily dependent on the different fields each entity has. If you are not familiar with this yet, please check out our <a href="UserGuide.html#ParameterConstraints">user guide</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process of parsing a line into a mentor or a participant is very similar, so two entities - participant and team - will be explained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, the following is a sequence diagram for parsing a CSV line into a participant. The line to be parsed is <code>"P,ID,Bruce Wayne,12345678,wbruce@wayne.ent"</code>.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 17. <code>CsvUtil</code>: Parsing to Participant Sequence Diagram</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given CSV line is first split by commas (also allows commas surrounded by arbitrary number of spaces). Then, each <code>String</code> in the array is (attempted to be) converted into corresponding fields of a Participant. As the diagram shows, each field class has its own method for checking if the given <code>String</code> argument is valid - in the form of <code>isValidField()</code> method, where <code>Field</code> is replaced by its respective class name. Once each field is successfully converted, a Participant is created with the parsed fields. The process of parsing into a Mentor is practically equivalent of that of a Participant. The only change is in the fields being parsed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next is a sequence diagram for parsing a CSV line into a team. The line to be parsed is <code>"T,,Justice League,[P-1|P-2],M-1,Social,100,Save the Earth,1"</code>.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 18. <code>CsvUtil</code>: Parsing to Team Sequence Diagram</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also for teams, each corresponding <code>String</code> is converted to its field counterpart just like participants and mentors. Hence, <code>isValidField()</code> method was omitted from the diagram. The difference lies in the fact that for teams, Alfred must check if any participants or mentors it makes a reference to actually exists in <code>Model</code>. Thus, <code>CsvUtil</code> calls <code>getParticipant()</code> and <code>getMentor()</code> methods exposed by the <code>Model</code> class. If there are any exceptions raised while retrieving the participants and mentors, that line in CSV will not be loaded onto Alfred.</p>

<p>Other than the CSV file path, if the user specifies an additional file path, Alfred will create a new CSV file path at that location containing every line in the user-given CSV file that had an error. For example, if lines 4, 6, and 7 were invalid in the imported CSV file, the error CSV file will contain only three lines, namely lines 4, 6, and 7 of the user-given CSV file.</p>

<p>Exporting all the data from Alfred to a CSV file is nice, but sometimes, the user may only want the data of a specific entity.

<p>The overall flow is the same so you can refer to the aforementioned <a href="#ExportCommandActivityDiagram">activity diagram</a> and <a href="#ExportCommandSequenceDiagram">sequence diagram</a> for more information.

For each subclass, they will retrieve the respective <code>ReadOnlyEntityList</code> and pass to <code>CsvUtil</code>. The above activity diagram shows that in <code>CsvUtil</code>, it makes three method calls to itself: <code>writeToCsv(File, MentorList)</code>, <code>writeToCsv(File, ParticipantList)</code>, and <code>writeToCsv(File, TeamList)</code>.

<p>The feature has been updated in v1.4 to support multiple undos/redos. This means that invoking <code>undo N</code>/<code>redo N</code> on Alfred, where <code>N</code>

Alfred&#8217;s data is held in memory within the <code>ModelManager</code> object. After the execution of commands that mutate the data in Alfred, a deep copy
of all 3 EntityLists is made and saved as a <code>ModelHistoryRecord</code> in <code>ModelHistoryManager</code>. A deep copy is necessary to ensure that
any subsequent changes to data will not alter the data in the <code>ModelHistoryRecord</code>, allowing each <code>ModelHistoryRecord</code> to serve as
a pristine record of the state of the data in Alfred at the end of the execution of each command.</p>

<p>Whenever the <code>undo</code> command is invoked, <code>ModelHistoryManager</code> returns a <code>ModelHistoryRecord</code>.

certain commands, such as <code>import</code>, which provides a best-effort implementation and tries to import as many valid data entries

<p>Given that the Undo/Redo feature saves the state of the data in Alfred after the execution of TrackableState commands,
it is important to ensure that memory usage by <code>ModelHistoryManager</code> is limited, otherwise Alfred will run very slowly and
potentially crash once a substantial number of commands have been executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to accommodate this design for the Undo/Redo feature, we decided to limit the number of <code>ModelHistoryRecord</code> stored in
<code>ModelHistoryManager</code> to 50. It is unlikely that a user would want to undo more than 50 commands at a go, as that would indicate
a very significant error in the workflow, and recovering from that should not have a reliance on the Undo/Redo feature.</p>

<p>Closely related to the undo/redo feature, the <code>history</code> feature allows you to examine up to 50 previously executed commands
in order to provide you with a visual understanding of the history of commands executed. Specifically, it provides you information
on how many commands are undo-able/redo-able, and which commands are undo-able/redo-able. Otherwise, it can be difficult to
know which commands you are undo/redo-ing, especially when many commands have been executed.</p>

<p>Most of the functionality required for the <code>history</code> feature is similar to that of the <code>undo</code>/<code>redo</code> feature. Specifically,
there is a similar reliance on the <code>ModelHistory</code> interface and its implementation <code>ModelHistoryManager</code> to provide the information
on which commands are undo-able and redo-able, along with their respective command input strings. See the sequence diagram below

<p>Since <code>ModelHistoryManager</code> keeps a linear history of Alfred&#8217;s data state after commands are executed, and it has a pointer
to the current data state, the redo-able commands are simply the ones after the pointer, and the undo-able commands are the one before
the pointer. The panels displayed in the "History" section of the Graphical User Interface is simply a visual representation of
this sequential ordering of datas states. The call to <code>getCommandHistory()</code> in Model will return an ArrayList of CommandRecords, where each CommandRecord
specifies the command input string as well as whether the CommandRecord is a delimiter. This ArrayList is then provided back to
the UI for rendering in the "History" section of the Graphical User Interface.</p>

<p>Since Alfred is ultimately a Command-Line Interface (CLI) application, it would be good to integrate some of the more useful features
of CLI applications into Alfred. This feature allows users to go through previously executed commands by pressing the ALT+UP/DOWN
arrow keys. Although it would be more convenient to use the UP/DOWN arrow keys to navigate the command history, the UP/DOWN arrow
keys have been mapped to the Command Suggestions feature in Alfred.</p>
</div>

in the csv file, but seeks to import as many valid data entries as possible. Hence, the <code>import</code> command can be navigated to using

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A separate class was created for managing the command history. Although this meant that Model would have a further
dependency on another class and hence cause an increase in the coupling between objects, this implementation adheres
to the Single Responsibility Principle and abstracts away the details of handling the command history to a purpose-built class.
This adheres better to the OOP-style of programming and results in conceptually cleaner code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to ensure that <code>CommandHistoryManager</code> does not occupy an increasingly large portion of memory as more and more
commands are executed, it is necessary to limit the number of commands that are stored. Otherwise, Alfred&#8217;s performance
will suffer as more commands are executed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most CLI applications with such a Command History Navigation feature would use the UP/DOWN arrow keys directly, but the UP/DOWN
arrow keys have been mapped for a different use (Command Suggestion Feature) in Alfred. Hence, we decided to use the ALT modifier key for the feature. It is
an inconvenience, but likely a minor one.</p>

<p>Step 5: <code>LogicManager</code> then executes the <code>AddScoreCommand</code> object upon which the <code>AddScoreCommand</code> object calls <code>Model</code> 's <code>addTeamScore()</code> method which updates the specific team&#8217;s score within <code>Model</code>. The updating is done by the <code>updateTeam(teamID, updatedTeam)</code> method of <code>Model</code> which updates the Team object with ID "teamID" within <code>Model</code> to match the "updatedTeam" team object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 6: Upon updating the team&#8217;s score in <code>Model</code>, the <code>AddScoreCommand</code> object creates a new <code>CommandResult</code> object which is returned to the UI component (not shown in the diagram) to display a feedback message to the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though the above diagram and steps are designed in the context of a <code>score add</code> command, the logic applies to every other type of <code>score</code> command as well. The only difference is that the <code>ScoreCommandParser</code> creates the appropriate command object for the command and each command object calls a different method from <code>Model</code>, as per the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><code>score subtract</code>: <code>ScoreCommandParser</code> creates a new <code>SubtractScoreCommand</code> instead of an <code>AddScoreCommand</code> and this <code>SubtractScoreCommand</code> object calls the <code>subtractTeamScore()</code> method of <code>Model</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>score set</code> and <code>score reset</code>: <code>ScoreCommandParser</code> creates a new <code>SetScoreCommand</code> instead of an <code>AddScoreCommand</code> and this <code>SetScoreCommand</code> object calls the <code>setTeamScore()</code> of method <code>Model</code>.</p>

<h4 id="design-considerations-8"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations-8">4.9.2. Design Considerations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To develop the <code>score</code> feature a few considerations and decisions had to be made with regards to how to implement the feature at various steps. This section focuses on some of the aspects wherein we faced dilemmas and how we addressed them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> How to implement the Score Commands</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, Alfred&#8217;s score commands all inherit from a single <code>ScoreCommand</code> abstract class rather than each command class inheriting directly from the command class. This was done in order to provide a concrete base for the score commands, but more importantly also to make better use of polymorphism within our codebase. This use of polymorphism allows the Alfred codebase to avoid several code repetitions, for example by facilitating the use of a single parser class to parse the <code>score</code> commands as it can then simply return a <code>ScoreCommand</code> object regardless of which specific <code>score</code> command is called. Thanks to this, we avoid having to make a parser for every single <code>score</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> How to implement <code>score sub</code> (Subtract Score Command)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While traditionally a subtract command would be implemented using an add command only with negated values, this is not quite possible in Alfred&#8217;s case. Within Alfred <code>Score</code> objects have a strict restriction that they cannot be created with negative values as a team&#8217;s score can never be negative. This restriction cannot be relaxed as it ensures that any data being imported into Alfred does not violate this property either. Due to this the <code>score sub</code> command could be implemented by reusing the <code>AddScoreCommand</code> and hence why it has its own command class <code>SubtractScoreCommand</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Implementation of <code>score reset</code> command</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Create a <code>ResetScoreCommand</code> class</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Lowers confusion as all the relevant code is in its own class rather than mixed with other code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Leads to duplication of code as the command is very similar to the <code>score set</code> command, making it poor software engineering practice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (Current Choice):</strong> Reuse the <code>SetScoreCommand</code> class</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Better use of abstraction and reduces the amount of duplicate code written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Overcrowds a single class as feedback messages and other properties of the <code>score reset</code> command also need to be written within it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon close inspection it was observed that the removal of duplicate code would far outweigh the convenience and orderliness of having a separate class for the command, especially considering that a <code>ResetScoreCommand</code> would have far more duplicate code than unique code as compared to the <code>SetScoreCommand</code>. Bearing this in mind, we ultimately decided to choose "Alternative 2" as it would allow for better reuse of existing code and follow better software engineering practices.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>leaderboard</code> and <code>getTop K</code> commands are two very important features of Alfred as they allow the user to automatically sort the teams by their scores, fetch any number of top teams in the competition and identify and break ties between teams conveniently. The execution of either of these commands displays the resultant teams on the UI in their correct sorted order. The following subsections explore the implementation of each of these commands and provide an insight into the design consideration made when developing them.</p>

<p>rely on updating a <code>SortedList</code> of teams present within the <code>ModelManager</code> class, which will be referred to as <code>sortedTeamList</code> in subsequent sections. This list is used to display the command&#8217;s results on the UI.</p>

<p>From the above class diagram, there are two important matters to note regarding the implementation of these features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist none">
<ul class="none">
<li>
<p>1. The <code>LeaderboardCommand</code> and <code>GetTopTeamsCommand</code> are implemented as abstract classes which extend the <code>Command</code> abstract class. Any command to do with leaderboards or getting the top teams extends either one of these abstract classes depending on which command it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2. The <code>ModelManager</code> class uses another class <code>LeaderboardUtil</code> which provides utility methods for the Leaderboard and Get Top Teams commands, such as fetching an appropriate number of teams for the <code>getTop K</code> command and breaking ties between teams for both commands.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="leaderboard-command-implementation"><a class="link" href="#leaderboard-command-implementation">4.10.2. Leaderboard Command Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>leaderboard</code> command fetches a leaderboard consisting of all the teams registered for the hackathon, in descending order of their score. Additionally, if tiebreak methods are specified, ties between the teams are typically broken in one of two ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparison-based tiebreakers:</strong> wherein the user picks certain tiebreak methods which rely on comparing certain properties of teams, such as the number of participants they have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Comparison-based tiebreakers:</strong> wherein the user breaks ties on non-comparison based methods (currently only the "random" method) in addition to any Comparison-based tiebreakers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="SimpleLeaderboard-Explanation" class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command <code>leaderboard tb/moreParticipants</code>. For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to precede a tie-break method and "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants. Essentially this demonstrates the flow for a "Comparison-based tiebreak".</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 41. Interactions within Logic Component for SimpleLeaderboardCommand</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the above, the <code>LeaderboardCommandParser</code> class parses the tie-break part of the command, particularly "tb/moreParticipants". Based on this input, it creates a new <code>ArrayList&lt;Comparator&lt;Team&gt;&gt;</code> object and appends the appropriate comparators to it based on the specified tiebreak methods. A new <code>SimpleLeaderboardCommand</code> object is then created with this array list as its parameter and returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the <code>SimpleLeaderboardCommand</code> is then executed, it calls <code>Model</code> 's <code>setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators)</code> method with the input parameter being the <code>ArrayList&lt;Comparator&lt;Team&gt;&gt;</code> passed as parameter for the former&#8217;s creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Model</code> 's <code>setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators)</code> method updates the <code>SortedList</code> of teams within <code>Model</code> itself, which is then displayed on the UI when the new <code>CommandResult</code> object is created and returned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This flow of events, albeit a few differences, is the same for every variation of the <code>leaderboard</code> and <code>getTop K</code> commands explored subsequently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do note that if the user&#8217;s input did not specify any tie-break methods, hence just being <code>leaderboard</code> then the <code>SimpleLeaderboardCommand</code> object would be created with an empty ArrayList of comparators. The flow of events for this particular scenario would be unchanged from the above illustration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it often occurs that even tiebreak methods cannot separate two teams in a hackathon, for which organizers randomly select a winner from the tied teams, basing it purely on fair luck. The <code>leaderboard</code> command with the tiebreak method <code>random</code> is used to provide this functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command "leaderboard tb/moreParticipants random". For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to denote a tie-break method and "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants, and "random" is another non-comparison based tie-break method.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 42. Interactions within Logic Component for LeaderboardCommand with Random Winners</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above sequence follows the exact same logic as that for the Simple Leaderboard as explained above (See <a href="#SimpleLeaderboard-Explanation">[SimpleLeaderboard-Explanation]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in this case the <code>LeaderWithRandomClass</code> calls the <code>setTopK(teamListSize, comparators)</code> method of <code>Model</code> which essentially breaks any remaining ties after applying the tie-break methods between teams on a random basis, and fetches a number of teams equal to <code>teamListSize</code> which is the size of the <code>sortedTeamList</code> reflecting the total number of teams in the hackathon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secondly, <code>Model</code> calls its own method <code>setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators)</code>, which essentially resets the <code>sortedTeamList</code> of teams clearing it of any sorting, and then applies the new comparators to it, before the algorithm for random winners can be applied to the <code>sortedTeamList</code>.</p>

<h4 id="Leaderboard-DesignConsideration"><a class="link" href="#Leaderboard-DesignConsideration">4.10.3. Leaderboard Design Considerations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were several questions we asked ourselves over the course of developing the leaderboard feature. The following contains certain aspects we had to consider during the development stage and details how and why we decided to use a certain methodologies over others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> How to store the sorted list of participants</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Use the existing List in <code>ModelManager</code> storing the teams.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easier to implement as lesser extra code involved, as most getters and setters have already been coded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Sorting will be more complicated and potentially slower with large number of teams as the other lists are <code>FilteredList</code> objects, whose API doesn&#8217;t allow direct sorting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: An existing List is likely to be used by other commands to display data on the UI, so with any sorting will have to undone each time after use; a process which is prone to careless errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (Current Choice):</strong> Use a new <code>SortedList</code> object from the JavaFX Library</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easy and quick to sort contents with the <code>SortedList</code> API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pros: A new list means the sorting will not interfere with any other feature&#8217;s operations, such as the <code>list</code> command which uses the existing <code>filteredTeamList</code> holding all the teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Another List to handle in <code>ModelManager</code> which increases the amount of code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the overwhelming benefits and conveniences that a new <code>SortedList</code> of teams would bring in the development of Alfred&#8217;s <code>leaderboard</code> and <code>getTop K</code> commands, we decided to rely on "Alternative 2" with regards to this dilemma.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Designing Leaderboard&#8217;s Command Classes</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Use a single <code>LeaderboardCommand</code> class</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Lesser duplicate code as both ("random" and "non-random") tiebreak methods can be handled within a single class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Introduces control coupling as the <code>LeaderboardCommandParser</code> will have to send a flag to <code>LeaderboardCommand</code> to indicate whether "random" should be applied or not as a means of tie-break.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (Current Choice):</strong> Use an Abstract <code>LeaderboardCommand</code> class inheriting from <code>Command</code> which any <code>leaderboard</code> related commands will themselves extend.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Single Responsibility Principle will be better respected as any change in logic for one type of <code>leaderboard</code> command will only affect its respective class. Secondly, no longer a need for a flag as the parser can directly call the appropriate command class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Introduces slight duplication in code as each class will contain a similar segments of code for checking the status of the teams in <code>Model</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We decided to follow "Alternative 2". Firstly, if a single class were being used, it would be difficult to distinguish which type of <code>leaderboard</code> command should be called - whether a leaderboard with or without "random" as tiebreak should be used. This would require the <code>LeaderboardCommandParser</code> to pass a flag signalling whether the "random" version should be called or not, which introduces control coupling. Although with a single distinct method (ie "random") this seems manageable, as the scale of Alfred increases with more non-comparison based methods such as "random" being introduced, passing a flag from <code>LeaderboardCommandParser</code> to the <code>Leaderboard</code> command class would become less and less manageable. Secondly, we wanted to avoid coupling the <code>Parser</code> and <code>Command</code> classes in a way which <code>Parser</code> influences the behaviour of the <code>Command</code> as it introduces leeway for errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Where to Write Algorithms used by <code>leaderboard</code> (and <code>getTop NUMBER</code>) Command</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Write the methods as private within <code>ModelManager</code> itself</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Relevant code is in close proximity to where it is being called allowing for easy reference of what is being done and quick rectification if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Would harm Single Responsibility Principle as <code>ModelManager</code> would need to be changed in case there is change in required to the Leaderboard Algorithms, whereas it should only be changed if there is a change required to <code>Model</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (Current Choice):</strong> Create a new <code>LeaderboardUtil</code> class</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Maintains single responsibility principle and ensures greater abstraction as complicated algorithms are simply handled by another class altogether.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Increases the amount of coding and documentation required. Additionally, it brings about the inconvenience of having to shift between classes to view the available methods and their implementations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Alternative 2" was eventually selected as it follows better Object-Oriented Programming practices. By abstracting away the methods used to sort and tie-break teams and keeping them in another class, the overall readability of the code is enhanced and would be easier for any future programmers working on this project to understand and work on.</p>

<h4 id="get-top-teams-implementation"><a class="link" href="#get-top-teams-implementation">4.10.4. Get Top Teams Implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>getTop K</code> command fetches the top "K" number teams sorted in descending order of their points, where K is a positive integer inputted by the user. The <code>getTop K</code> command follows a similar pattern as the <code>leaderboard</code> command in the sense that ties between teams are broken in one of two ways:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Comparison-based tiebreakers:</strong> wherein the user picks certain tiebreak methods which rely on comparing certain properties of teams, such as the number of participants they have.</p>

<p>Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command "getTop 3 tb/moreParticipants".

<p>The above diagram follows a logic very similar to the <code>leaderboard</code> command&#8217;s logic. However, in this case a <code>TopTeamsCommandParser</code> object is created to parse the arguments "3 tb/moreParticipants" which returns a <code>SimpleTopKCommand</code> object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, the <code>SimpleTopCommand</code> object calls <code>Model</code> 's <code>setTopK(3, comparators)</code> method which essentially modifies the <code>sortedTeamList</code> within <code>Model</code> to only show the top three teams as per their scores and the relevant tiebreakers as per the list of comparators <code>comparators</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also noteworthy that <code>Model</code> calls its own method <code>setSimpleLeaderboard(comparators)</code> which was associated with the <code>leaderboard</code> command. This is however a simple reuse of code to set the reset <code>Model</code> 's <code>sortedTeamList</code> and apply the relevant comparators to it, before the algorithm for fetching the top three (or any number) teams can be applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When it comes to the <code>getTop K</code> command being used with the "random" method of tiebreak, the flow of events is resembles the above very closely. Given below is the sequence diagram illustrating the flow of events which generates a result for the user when he types the command "getTop 3 tb/moreParticipants random". For your reference, here the prefix "tb/" is used to denote a tie-break method and "moreParticipants" is a tie-break method which gives a higher position to teams with more participants whereas "random" represents the "random" method of tiebreak.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the implementation of the <code>getTop K</code> command is almost identical to that of the <code>leaderboard</code> command, the design considerations made for the <code>leaderboard</code> command apply to the implementation of this feature as well (See <a href="#Leaderboard-DesignConsideration">Section 4.10.3, &#8220;Leaderboard Design Considerations&#8221;</a>). However, there were some unique aspects we had to consider with regards to the <code>getTop K</code> command, all of which is detailed below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Where to Store the Top NUMBER Teams</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (Current Choice):</strong> Use the <code>SortedList</code> in <code>ModelManager</code> used for  the <code>leaderboard</code> command.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Requires lesser code - a new list would involve new getters and setters and additional code in the UI component to display this list on the UI.</p>

<li>
<p>Cons: Can be cause for confusion since <code>leaderboard</code> and <code>getTop K</code> commands would be using the same list.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 2:</strong> Use a new <code>SortedList</code> object.</p>

<li>
<p>Pros: Less confusion as the <code>leaderboard</code> and <code>getTop K</code> commands use distinct lists for their operations.</p>

<li>
<p>Cons: Additional code and attention required to handle an additional list, which can lead to potential errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After careful consideration, "Alternative 1" was chosen as it would make fewer modification to <code>ModelManager</code> and the <code>UI</code> component, particularly with regards to adding duplicate code to handle the two different lists. Moreover, since the calls to <code>ModelManager</code> 's methods reset the <code>SortedList</code> storing the sorted teams, there is likely to be lesser confusion and room for error when handling a single list for the two different commands.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Handling Situation when <code>K</code> is greater than the number of teams</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1 (Current Choice):</strong> Show all the teams in the hackathon</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We decided to prioritise user convenience in this situation and rather than displaying an error every time he inputs a value too large for <code>K</code> in the <code>getTop K</code> command, we decided to show all the teams. This aspect of the feature has been made abundantly clear in the User Guide and seeks to minimise user frustration especially since we do not want the user to worry too much about remembering how many teams have signed up.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Implementation of Leaderboard</p>

<li>
<p>Pros: Better and greater re-usage of code present within <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>

<p>The reason "Alternative 2" was selected was because <code>ModelManager</code> 's <code>setSimpleLeaderboard(ArrayList&lt;Comparator&lt;Team&gt;&gt; comparators)</code> method resets the <code>SortedList</code> of teams within <code>ModelManager</code> and applies the relevant comparators to it to sort it as desired. Hence, it is abstracting away this process into a single method so a better re-usage of code can take place in other methods. This method is reused by <code>ModelManager</code> 's <code>setTopK()</code> method when using the <code>getTop K</code> command, whereas the <code>setSimpleLeaderboard(ArrayList&lt;Comparator&lt;Team&gt;&gt; comparators)</code> method is sufficient to sort <strong>all</strong> the teams in the desired order. So instead of calling it again within another method, the <code>setSimpleLeaderboard(ArrayList&lt;Comparator&lt;Team&gt;&gt; comparators)</code> method which was meant to abstract away some processes is itself used to handle the <code>leaderboard</code> command. So indeed in the end, "Alternative 2" does not introduce duplication of code, but rather introduces better use of abstraction.</p>

<h4 id="tiebreaking-and-filtering-by-subject"><a class="link" href="#tiebreaking-and-filtering-by-subject">4.10.6. Tiebreaking and Filtering by Subject</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the above sections, the UML diagrams gloss over how tiebreaking and filtering by subjects is parsed and understood by Alfred. The basic of tie-breaking revolves around using <code>Comparator</code> s to sort the teams in a particular order. Each tiebreak method available in Alfred has a <code>Comparator</code> associated to it and all these can be found in the <code>Comparators</code> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The activity diagram below illustrates the internal workings within the <code>LeaderboardCommandParser</code> and <code>TopTeamsCommandParser</code> when parsing tiebreak methods. Do note that in the below diagram the term <code>Parser</code> encapsulates both of these <code>Parser</code> s as they operate in almost identical ways.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 45. Handling of Tiebreak Methods</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the above there is one important aspect to note: the <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>Comparator&lt;Team&gt;</code> objects created in the second step. This is the <code>ArrayList</code> referred to in the previous sections which is tasked with containing and transferring the comparators which will be used to sort the teams in their appropriate order to form the leaderboard or top teams. This <code>ArrayList</code> is used as an input parameter for both <code>leaderboard</code> and <code>getTop K</code> command related classes, as explored in previous sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, before <code>comparators</code> can be passed as an argument to the commands, it is reversed. This is done intentionally so the comparators related to each tiebreak method are applied in an order such that they preserve the oder the user wants the tiebreak methods to be applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secondly, do note that the diagram above assumes there are no syntax errors made by the user when typing out the command. In case of any errors in the command, a <code>ParseException</code> would be thrown warning the user of such a situation. These have been excluded from the above diagram to prevent overcrowding and a deviation from the basic logic.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though this was a relatively straightforward subset of our <code>leaderboard</code> and <code>getTop K</code> command, there were still a few, small design considerations made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> How to separate tiebreak methods</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Each tiebreak method preceded by a new tiebreak prefix ("tb/")</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Follows the paradigm followed by other commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Very tedious for the user to type and adds difficulty in parsing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (Current Choice):</strong> Each tiebreak method separated by a single whitespace</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easier to implement and more convenient for the user to type as well. Code-wise it is easy and quick to customize which character to separate methods on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Introduces a slight variation as other commands don&#8217;t use whitespaces as separation methods which might confuse the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To better consider the user&#8217;s needs and convenience, "Alternative 2" was selected. So as to not confuse users, this implementation has been made abundantly clear in the User Guide as well. From a developer&#8217;s perspective, this implementation is also more customizable to better respond to changes in user&#8217;s preferences as the separation character can easily be changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aspect:</strong> Where to create comparators</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 1:</strong> Create comparators when parsing each tiebreak method</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Easier to implement as it does not require additional classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Can overcrowd a single method or class especially as more comparison methods are added. This is also a poor use of abstraction and would not respect Single Responsibility Principle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2 (Current Choice):</strong> Create a separate <code>Comparators</code> class where relevant comparators are created beforehand and can be invoke using static methods.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Better use of abstraction and maintains Single Responsibility Principle as the parser class can focus on solely parsing the user commands.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, "Alternative 2" was selected as it follows better software engineering practices by making better use of abstraction. Despite requiring slightly more code and classes, it would still be better than "Alternative 1" which breaks the Single Responsibility Principle as the parser class would have to be changed for changes in tiebreak methods in addition to changes in methods of parsing.</p>

<p>Currently, Alfred allows users to view specific entities by their <code>ID</code> using the <code>view ENTITY ID</code>.
However, it may not be convenient for users to remember the <code>ID</code> of specific users, especially since

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help Alfred become a viable alternative to Excel, Alfred also offers an improved <code>find</code> function
that has been inspired by the power of Excel Macros.
<code>find</code> offers a search by a single field and multiple fields. The list of fields that can be searched for
for each entity can be found in the
<a href="UserGuide.html#finding-a-specific-entity-code-find-mentor-team-participant-n-name-code">user guide</a>, or by
simply typing in an incorrect command in the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The find command also offers an option to do a negative search of the fields in the list. This can be
done via the <code>EXCLUDE</code> keyword. All the parameters that come after the keyword will undergo a negative
search. Figure 41 shows an example of this. <code>find participant EXCLUDE n/uc</code> will look for all participants
whose name that does not contain "uc".</p>

<p>The left half of the diagram covers creation of the <code>FindParticipantCommand</code> while the right half
details the interaction with the <code>Model</code>. There are 5 main steps in the execution of the command.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><code>FindCommandAllocator</code> allocates the correct parser for the find command based on the entity name
provided. If the entity name is incorrect, then an error will be thrown and execution will terminate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>FindParticipantCommandParser</code> will then parse the String provided to it. If the string provided
is invalid and does not follow the specified format, an error will be thrown. Likewise, if the find command
is called and no parameters are provided, an error will also be thrown. During the parsing, the parser splits
the input string given into two separate strings, one for normal parameters and the other for parameters
that will undergo negated search. Two separate <code>ArgumentMultimap</code> objects are generated using the two
strings. These <code>ArgumentMultimap</code> objects are the same as the ones found in AB3 and thus behave in a similar manner
and have the same constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are no errors, the <code>FindParticipantCommandParser</code> then creates
a <code>FindParticipantCommand</code> which in turn generates the predicate it would use
to filter the relevant <code>EntityList</code> by. These predicates are stored as static variables in a central <code>Predicates</code>
file. <code>FindParticipantCommand</code> selects the predicates based on which fields are provided in the original
input string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With these predicates, it then calls the <code>findParticipant</code> method on the model with the generated predicate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of <code>Participant</code> objects is then returned, and is also printed onto the console for the user&#8217;s
reference. Then, at <code>FindParticipantCommand</code>, a <code>CommandResult</code> is returned after the smooth execution
of this <code>find</code> operation.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 1</strong>: Use a SQL style query string</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: SQL syntax is universally used to communicate with databases and is clean</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: Users may not be familiar with SQL</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2</strong>: Use the current format of <code>n/NAME e/EMAIL &#8230;&#8203;</code> (current)</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternative 1 would take the form
    of <code>find where name="John" and phone like "123" and not email="gmail.com"</code>. This would also have the added
benefit of better on-boarding SQL users. However,
while SQL-style syntax  is relatively clean and understandable, we decided not to implement this
for the following reasons.
The first reason was that SQL queries are meant to be used for large databases with thousands of columns,
hence, the structure of the query must be clean to reduce the number of bugs made in the query. On the
other hand, each <code>Entity</code> in Alfred only has a small number of fields (less than 6) and thus the current
query format would still be understandable. Secondly, as mentioned above, users may not be familiar with SQL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence, Alternative 2 was chosen as it would be more
user friendly for users to the existing command format instead of memorizing a new format.
Furthermore, implementing a new format would take more time as
the new query format would have to be written and tested thoroughly, thus negatively impacting development
velocity.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative 1</strong>: Store the Predicates in a central file (current)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Makes the predicates accessible to the whole application
hence reducing code duplication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: A large conditional statement would be needed in each Command class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative 2</strong>: Store the Predicates within each <code>FindCommand</code> class</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pros: Each predicate is only used by one class, so this would have resulted in a better separation
of concerns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons: A large conditional statement or hash map would still be needed to decide which predicates to
use</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, we decided to use Alternative 1. Although most of the predicates are only used once, they are
all unmodifiable functions that return a predicate in the form of a closure. Thus, the risks associated
with unrestricted access and modification of an object are greatly reduced. Furthermore, predicates are
also used in other parts of the codebase. Hence, it is a good idea to consolidate them in a single location.
Thus, if another class in the codebase needed to implement another predicate, all it had to do would be to check
this central file to see if a similar one was already written, as opposed to trawling though the entire codebase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The large conditional statement was also not a major issue. This is because although it is large, the
code within was understandable and this would have facilitated its extension, as compared to prematurely
refactoring out into smaller submodules.</p>

<p>The system should not seem sluggish if it contains less than 1500 entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project is not intended for use on mobile and only should be used on desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application assumes that the user is comfortable with the concept of the command line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application is meant to run offline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application is largely a personnel/HR manager, and is not expected to do anything more than that (eg hackathon finances etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application is to be used for a single hackathon only and not for multiple hackathons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application assumes that the hackathon is a short term affair (no longer than 4 days).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application assumes that this is an English medium hackathon and that no non-English names are expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GUI should display the result of commands in an intuitive, organized manner that is readable by the laymen(as part of the organization/ affordability of the application).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pros:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is extremely versatile as Google Sheets come with a list of extremely helpful macros that could help in the storage of participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The display and UI of Google Sheets is extremely intuitive and will come as second nature to anyone using the web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convenient and accessible by multiple HR personnel simultaneously.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Google Sheets has no concept of objects and thus it cannot accurately depict the relationships between our different entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As above, it is hard to look for relationships between our entities, such as Team/Participant associations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Sheets may be useful for storing information, but it does not support command line arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Sheets is also unable to perform input validation as it lacks the logic to do so.</p>
